Our team built a trip simulator to show their fleet dashboard in real time.</p>\n<h1 id=\"solutions\"><a href=\"#solutions\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Solutions</h1>\n<p>We helped Modus rearchitect their inventory management and the white labeled CRM platform.</p>\n<p>As Modus grew, it needed its infrastructure to scale. We helped Modus process and report on millions of trips taken by their customers. We used PostgreSQL to shard the trips database and improve the performance of the reporting infrastructure. As the business spread to multiple geographies, increasing the demand on the reliability of the inventory service, we migrated it from a pure HTTP based microservice written in Rails to a RabbitMQ based system to improve its reliability and handle the changes to the inventory service without affecting the upstream systems.</p>\n<p>Our team added unit tests to the codebase and moved it from Rails 3 to Rails 4, and helped set up running tests on CircleCI and automated the deployment with Capistrano. We also setup a build monitor to serve as an information radiator, and helped in turning parts of the API written with Rails and Grape to Elixir and Phoenix.</p>\n<p>We then built the UI for their flagship Zephyr fleet management platform.</p>\n<p>Our experts used React, ImmutableJS and Immstruct to build a high performance UI that integrates Google Maps, SVG and Canvas for charting, and reports and websockets for live driver tracking. Along with this feature, we built utility apps that simulated driving based on past trips to easily test and demo the user interface.</p>\n"},"clients":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"28","name":"Redacted","style":"green","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"27","name":"Hotstar","style":"fullBlack","logo":"org/hotstar.png"}},{"node":{"id":"26","name":"Framework","style":"fullBlack","logo":"org/framework.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"25","name":"Routinr","style":"purple-blue","logo":"org/routinr.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"24","name":"eVisitNB","style":"red","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"23","name":"EquipmentFX","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"22","name":"Beatclub","style":"dark-grey","logo":"org/beatclub.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"21","name":"Social Lab","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"20","name":"IFAD","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"19","name":"10i Commerce","style":"dark-blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"18","name":"IDExcel","style":"grey","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"17","name":"Aisle","style":"green","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"16","name":"Trazaar","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"15","name":"Jiffle Now","style":"pink","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"14","name":"Farmstead","style":"green","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"13","name":"Inkl","style":"dark-blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"12","name":"Glydel","style":"grey","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"11","name":"Messaging Solution Provider","style":"black","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"10","name":"EAM360","style":"red","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"9","name":"TuneCore","style":"black","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"8","name":"Abridge","style":"orange","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"7","name":"GE Digital Services","style":"green","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"6","name":"Gaea Global","style":"red","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"5","name":"Genetic Direction","style":"dark-blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"4","name":"IDEO","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"3","name":"Fankave","style":"black","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"2","name":"Caratlane","style":"blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"1","name":"Modus","style":"pink","logo":""}}]}},"context":{}}
