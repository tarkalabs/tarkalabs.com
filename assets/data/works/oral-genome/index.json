Their mobile-enabled platform empowers clinicians to detect risks early and provide preventive care at the point of need.</p>\n<p>When scaling up, they faced two pressing goals: revamping their Provider Portal for clinicians and delivering a white-labeled mobile app with redesigns for one of their largest customers. They partnered with us to fast-track development, improve code maintainability, and ensure the product was launch-ready ahead of schedule.</p>\n<h1 id=\"background\"><a href=\"#background\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Background</h1>\n<h2 id=\"why-modernizing-the-platform-mattered\"><a href=\"#why-modernizing-the-platform-mattered\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Why modernizing the platform mattered.</h2>\n<p>The global digital diagnostics market is expected to reach USD 3.23 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of over 18.08%. With preventive healthcare and early detection driving this momentum, saliva-based testing is emerging as a breakthrough area due to its speed, accuracy, and non-invasive nature.</p>\n<p>Oral Genome’s technology is at the forefront of this shift. To seize the opportunity, they needed a scalable and customizable platform, one that could support clinicians, adapt to customer requirements, and maintain a rapid development pace without sacrificing quality.</p>\n<h1 id=\"challenges\"><a href=\"#challenges\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Challenges</h1>\n<h2 id=\"what-we-anticipated-along-the-journey\"><a href=\"#what-we-anticipated-along-the-journey\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What we anticipated along the journey.</h2>\n<p>While their project-level code organization was strong, the lack of structured file-level organization made onboarding difficult and slowed feature delivery.</p>\n<p>Design coordination emerged as a key hurdle. An external agency handled UI/UX but frequently updated designs without notifying the dev team, causing rework.</p>\n<p>Additional hurdles included:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Creating customizable white labeled app configurations for clients.</li>\n<li>Implementing Single Sign-On (SSO) for a seamless clinician experience.</li>\n<li>Balancing manual QA for the Provider Portal with automated testing for the mobile app.</li>\n<li>Navigating delays from an outsourced design agency, which often provided updates late or without prior notice.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At the heart of it all was their primary business goal: achieving a faster go-to-market timeline.</p>\n<h1 id=\"our-approach\"><a href=\"#our-approach\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Our Approach</h1>\n<h2 id=\"building-for-scalability-and-speed\"><a href=\"#building-for-scalability-and-speed\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Building for scalability and speed.</h2>\n<p>We began by auditing Oral Genome’s app and portal codebase to identify structural improvements.
