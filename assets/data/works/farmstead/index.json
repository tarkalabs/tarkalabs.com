This was done by setting up factories and helper methods that could be used for new features.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reimagining-the-react-front-end\"><a href=\"#reimagining-the-react-front-end\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Reimagining the React front-end</h3>\n<p>Our team started with re-organizing the front-end codebase into a robust React application, and set standards for the codebase. We reimagined and streamlined the end-to-end shopping experience for the user.</p>\n<p>After initial research, we also integrated Redux into the React app and designed it to be functional, independent and separable from the monolith that it was under.</p>\n<p>During the front-end rehaul, we organized all CSS styles into comprehensive stylesheets and enabled consistent CX across the application.</p>\n<h3 id=\"rebuilding-a-robust-back-end\"><a href=\"#rebuilding-a-robust-back-end\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Rebuilding a robust back-end</h3>\n<p>Our consultants initiated back-end refactoring by separating JSON-serving endpoints and HTML-serving endpoints.</p>\n<p>We optimized and reduced the overall response time by moving and monitoring all JSON serving endpoints, and studying the responses they were serving.</p>\n<p>Building a modular system and refactoring the codebase into separate modules across the application helped us reduce duplication.</p>\n<h3 id=\"integrating-improved-app-features\"><a href=\"#integrating-improved-app-features\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Integrating improved app features</h3>\n<p>We developed and deployed some critical features for the application:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Migrating the app from one location to serve multiple locations</li>\n<li>Streamlining driver allocation and routing systems to reduce driving time</li>\n<li>Increasing driver occupancy through intelligent driver allocation and routing</li>\n<li>Automating warehouse management to accelerate the shelf-to-pack time</li>\n</ul>\n"},"clients":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"27","name":"Hotstar","style":"fullBlack","logo":"org/hotstar.png"}},{"node":{"id":"26","name":"Framework","style":"fullBlack","logo":"org/framework.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"25","name":"Routinr","style":"purple-blue","logo":"org/routinr.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"24","name":"eVisitNB","style":"red","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"23","name":"EquipmentFX","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"22","name":"Beatclub","style":"dark-grey","logo":"org/beatclub.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"21","name":"Social Lab","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"20","name":"IFAD","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"19","name":"10i Commerce","style":"dark-blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"18","name":"IDExcel","style":"grey","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"17","name":"Aisle","style":"green","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"16","name":"Trazaar","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"15","name":"Jiffle Now","style":"pink","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"14","name":"Farmstead","style":"green","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"13","name":"Inkl","style":"dark-blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"12","name":"Glydel","style":"grey","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"11","name":"Messaging Solution Provider","style":"black","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"10","name":"EAM360","style":"red","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"9","name":"TuneCore","style":"black","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"8","name":"Abridge","style":"orange","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"7","name":"GE Digital Services","style":"green","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"6","name":"Gaea Global","style":"red","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"5","name":"Genetic Direction","style":"dark-blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"4","name":"IDEO","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"3","name":"Fankave","style":"black","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"2","name":"Caratlane","style":"blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"1","name":"Modus","style":"pink","logo":""}}]}},"context":{}}
