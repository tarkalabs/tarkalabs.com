And when two of the biggest players, Believe and Tunecore, bring their catalogs and systems together - accuracy is everything.</p>\n<h1 id=\"challenges\"><a href=\"#challenges\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Challenges</h1>\n<h2 id=\"what-we-anticipated-along-the-journey\"><a href=\"#what-we-anticipated-along-the-journey\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What we anticipated along the journey.</h2>\n<p>Our primary challenge was with a backfill process that we had to initiate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"high-volume-backfill\"><a href=\"#high-volume-backfill\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>High Volume Backfill</h3>\n<p>Tunecore had to transfer a backlog of 8 million songs to Believe’s backend, and their catalog albums and tracks had unique identifiers that had to be streamlined and standardized to the requirements of the new system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"metadata-variances\"><a href=\"#metadata-variances\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Metadata Variances</h3>\n<p>In our roadmap for accelerating the transcoding process, we anticipated issues with metadata variances between digital retailers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"disparate-ingestion-systems\"><a href=\"#disparate-ingestion-systems\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Disparate Ingestion Systems</h3>\n<p>The ingestion systems across retailers, marketplaces and services have unique delivery specifications, and this was a challenge we had to take into account while planning our transcoding pipeline.</p>\n<h1 id=\"research\"><a href=\"#research\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Research</h1>\n<h2 id=\"finding-solutions-with-the-future-in-mind\"><a href=\"#finding-solutions-with-the-future-in-mind\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Finding solutions with the future in mind.</h2>\n<p>Our research was extensively focused on studying the current systems used by Tunecore and Believe, in order to explore alternatives that could help improve cost efficiencies and allow the system to scale seamlessly.</p>\n<div>\n  <video src=\"/tunecore/tunecore_dist_testingbefore.mp4\" autoplay muted loop/>\n</div>\n<p>We also had to study existing and new metadata standards like XML and DDEX to streamline the product and release data, and make the files easy to access, catalog and transfer.</p>\n<p>Since accelerated transcoding was a key component, we explored prepackaged transcoding services like AWS Lambda and Elastic Transcoder.</p>\n<h1 id=\"advice\"><a href=\"#advice\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Advice</h1>\n<p>Our recommendations included AWS Lambda for on-demand transcoding and AWS SQS for queue processing to handle high volume transfers.</p>\n<p>To future-proof the system, we also recommended AWS Cloudwatch for monitoring pipelines and scaling, so that it could handle loads of upto 500,000 MAU.</p>\n<h1 id=\"solutions\"><a href=\"#solutions\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Solutions</h1>\n<h2 id=\"how-we-reengineered-the-mechanics-of-music-distribution\"><a href=\"#how-we-reengineered-the-mechanics-of-music-distribution\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>How we reengineered the mechanics of music distribution.</h2>\n<p>With an eye on performance improvement and complete modernization, our team set to work.</p>\n<div>\n  <video src=\"/tunecore/tunecore_dist_distribution.mp4\" autoplay muted loop/>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"refactored-the-distribution-system\"><a href=\"#refactored-the-distribution-system\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Refactored the distribution system</h3>\n<p>To modernize and drive faster iterations on the overall infrastructure and database design, we extracted and refactored the distribution system from the current application to its own microservice.</p>\n<div>\n  <video src=\"/tunecore/tunecore_dist_scaling.mp4\" autoplay muted loop/>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"optimized-the-system-for-scalability\"><a href=\"#optimized-the-system-for-scalability\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Optimized the system for scalability</h3>\n<p>Digital music distribution is a rapidly growing space, with increasing YoY growth and escalating demand.
