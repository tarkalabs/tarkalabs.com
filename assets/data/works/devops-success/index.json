In this process, we also collaborated with the backend engineering team to move from Sidekiq to SQS.</p>\n<p>This allowed us to set up custom CloudWatch metrics on queue length and visualize them on the dashboard. This approach saved the client approximately 50% of the cost of these workloads, while maintaining optimal performance. A further effort by the backend engineering team to rewrite the service from Rails to Go reduced it to 10% of the original cost.</p>\n<h3 id=\"migrating-to-docker-and-ecs\"><a href=\"#migrating-to-docker-and-ecs\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Migrating to Docker and ECS</h3>\n<p>We began by containerizing our client’s applications using Docker, which allowed for easier packaging and distribution of their applications. This was essential to modernize the tech stack.</p>\n<p>Containerizing your workloads enables you to treat your infrastructure as cattle rather than pets. Docker facilitated the transition from Capistrano on EC2-based deployments to the Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS), a more scalable and efficient container orchestration service. This migration enabled faster and more reliable deployments, simplified management, and better resource utilization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"implementing-circleci-and-codepipeline\"><a href=\"#implementing-circleci-and-codepipeline\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Implementing CircleCI and CodePipeline</h3>\n<p>To replace the existing Jenkins-based deployment process, we implemented CircleCI, a modern and user-friendly Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tool. CircleCI streamlined the deployment pipeline, providing better visibility into failing tests. We also set up CodePipeline to automate the deployment and visualize the value stream map.</p>\n<h3 id=\"automating-ecs-setup-with-terraform\"><a href=\"#automating-ecs-setup-with-terraform\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Automating ECS setup with Terraform</h3>\n<p>We enhanced infrastructure management using Terraform, an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool, to automate the provisioning and management of the client's ECS setup. Terraform's declarative configuration files ensured that the infrastructure was consistent, easily reproducible, and versioned, reducing the risk of human error and streamlining ongoing maintenance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"setting-up-cloudwatch-and-grafana-dashboards\"><a href=\"#setting-up-cloudwatch-and-grafana-dashboards\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Setting up CloudWatch and Grafana dashboards</h3>\n<p>Our consultants set up Amazon CloudWatch dashboards to provide comprehensive monitoring and logging for the client's applications. These dashboards exposed essential metrics and logs, allowing the client to quickly identify and address performance bottlenecks and improve the overall quality of their services. We also set up Grafana dashboards to surface business-level metrics on album deliveries and errors across various stores.\nAddressing memory leaks with jemalloc</p>\n<p>In collaboration with our client’s engineers, we identified and addressed memory leaks in their applications by moving to jemalloc, a memory allocator library that reduces fragmentation and improves efficiency. This change resulted in improved application stability and performance.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maintaining-golden-docker-images-for-various-projects\"><a href=\"#maintaining-golden-docker-images-for-various-projects\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Maintaining golden Docker images for various projects</h3>\n<p>We maintained golden Docker images for each project to ensure consistent and reproducible environments across the client's projects.
