It is lightweight and optimised for performance. We implemented the complex interactions that the landing page demanded using ScrollMagic.</p>\n<p>CSS3 transitions is expressive and highly performant way of animating the elements in the DOM that works well across different browsers. The key is to stick to the transition functions that are well adopted across different browsers. Our implementation took care of these concerns and successfully implemented all the interactions and experiences required by the design.</p>\n<h1 id=\"demo\"><a href=\"#demo\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Demo</h1>\n<div>\n  <video src=\"/ideo/c-delta-small.mp4\" autoplay muted loop />\n</div>\n"},"clients":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"28","name":"Redacted","style":"green","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"27","name":"Hotstar","style":"fullBlack","logo":"org/hotstar.png"}},{"node":{"id":"26","name":"Framework","style":"fullBlack","logo":"org/framework.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"25","name":"Routinr","style":"purple-blue","logo":"org/routinr.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"24","name":"eVisitNB","style":"red","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"23","name":"EquipmentFX","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"22","name":"Beatclub","style":"dark-grey","logo":"org/beatclub.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"21","name":"Social Lab","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"20","name":"IFAD","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"19","name":"10i Commerce","style":"dark-blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"18","name":"IDExcel","style":"grey","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"17","name":"Aisle","style":"green","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"16","name":"Trazaar","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"15","name":"Jiffle Now","style":"pink","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"14","name":"Farmstead","style":"green","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"13","name":"Inkl","style":"dark-blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"12","name":"Glydel","style":"grey","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"11","name":"Messaging Solution Provider","style":"black","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"10","name":"EAM360","style":"red","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"9","name":"TuneCore","style":"black","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"8","name":"Abridge","style":"orange","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"7","name":"GE Digital Services","style":"green","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"6","name":"Gaea Global","style":"red","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"5","name":"Genetic Direction","style":"dark-blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"4","name":"IDEO","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"3","name":"Fankave","style":"black","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"2","name":"Caratlane","style":"blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"1","name":"Modus","style":"pink","logo":""}}]}},"context":{}}
