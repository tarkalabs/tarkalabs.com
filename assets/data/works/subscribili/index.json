This can help patients access preventive and restorative care at transparent, affordable prices.</p>\n<p>To support their growing network of providers, Subscribili aimed to build ‘Sync’, a new platform that would allow practices to manage patients, appointments, and analytics more effectively.</p>\n<p>However, their existing MVP application was built on a monolithic architecture, creating performance bottlenecks and limiting the ability to evolve into a multi-product ecosystem.</p>\n<p>They partnered with Tarka Labs to rebuild their foundation - starting with a component library and a robust mono-repo structure to unify all applications under one modern architecture.</p>\n<h1 id=\"background\"><a href=\"#background\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Background</h1>\n<h2 id=\"why-was-a-scalable-foundation-critical\"><a href=\"#why-was-a-scalable-foundation-critical\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Why was a scalable foundation critical.</h2>\n<p>The demand for affordable, subscription-based healthcare is accelerating. Almost <a href=\"https://www.tebra.com/theintake/healthcare-reports/healthcare-subscription-models-patient-interest\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">48% of US people are interested</a> in subscription-based healthcare. Especially in the US dental market, where clinics are seeking ways to increase recurring revenue and strengthen patient relationships.</p>\n<p>Subscribili’s vision is to make in-office dental plans accessible and easy to manage. To bring this vision to life they needed a platform that could evolve alongside their growing business. But their MVP setup lacked the scalability, modularity, and maintainability needed to support new products and custom experiences.</p>\n<p>To move forward, they needed to transition from a standalone MVP to a scalable architecture that could support both Sync and future offerings, without disrupting existing customers or operations.</p>\n<h1 id=\"challenges\"><a href=\"#challenges\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Challenges</h1>\n<h2 id=\"what-we-anticipated-along-the-journey\"><a href=\"#what-we-anticipated-along-the-journey\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What we anticipated along the journey.</h2>\n<p>The initial platform lacked the flexibility needed for expansion. Adding new features or apps required repetitive work, and UI inconsistencies made the experience difficult to maintain.</p>\n<p>Some of the key challenges included:</p>\n<p>• Legacy codebase limitations: The MVP was built quickly, without modular architecture, making scaling complex.</p>\n<p>• Lack of a shared design system: Without reusable components, maintaining UI consistency was time-consuming.</p>\n<p>• Balancing scope and timelines: The team had to strike a balance between perfecting the new component library and delivering the Sync MVP on time.</p>\n<p>At the core, Subscribili needed a platform that would simplify scaling, standardize design and logic, and accelerate new product rollouts.</p>\n<h1 id=\"our-approach\"><a href=\"#our-approach\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Our Approach</h1>\n<h2 id=\"building-a-unified-system-for-scalability-and-reusability\"><a href=\"#building-a-unified-system-for-scalability-and-reusability\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Building a unified system for scalability and reusability.</h2>\n<p>Our first step was to review the existing Figma designs and establish a design tokenization process to ensure consistency across all interfaces. We then created a roadmap focused on two parallel goals. One - building a robust component library and two - setting up the mono-repo architecture for Sync.</p>\n<p>The process was guided by three core principles:</p>\n<p>• Atomic Design: Build reusable UI components that could adapt across all Subscribili products.</p>\n<p>• Integration of multiple API versions to support legacy features and newer micro service based end points.</p>\n<p>• Shared Logic: Create common packages and utilities to avoid duplication and promote DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles.</p>\n<h1 id=\"solution\"><a href=\"#solution\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Solution</h1>\n<h2 id=\"how-we-built-a-scalable-ecosystem-to-evolve\"><a href=\"#how-we-built-a-scalable-ecosystem-to-evolve\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>How we built a scalable ecosystem to evolve.</h2>\n<h3 id=\"component-library-development\"><a href=\"#component-library-development\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><em>Component Library Development</em></h3>\n<p>We developed a reusable UI component library based on atomic design principles, ensuring visual and functional consistency across all products. Components were triaged based on user access patterns and page hierarchy, optimizing for real-world workflows.</p>\n<h3 id=\"modern-mono-repo-architecture\"><a href=\"#modern-mono-repo-architecture\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><em>Modern Mono-repo Architecture</em></h3>\n<p>Using Turborepo, we built a unified mono-repo that houses shared logic, utilities, and versioned microservices. This helped with seamless integration between legacy and new applications. Also, this architecture supports modular development and improves caching efficiency.</p>\n<h3 id=\"flexible-deployment-environments\"><a href=\"#flexible-deployment-environments\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a><em>Flexible Deployment Environments</em></h3>\n<p>We deployed multiple environments to test across time zones and regions, enabling faster validation and smoother releases.</p>\n<p>Tech Stack: React, Zustand, Tanstack Router &#x26; Query, Tailwind, Radix, Turborepo</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-impact\"><a href=\"#the-impact\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The Impact</h1>\n<h2 id=\"built-for-performance-designed-for-scalability\"><a href=\"#built-for-performance-designed-for-scalability\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Built for performance. Designed for scalability.</h2>\n<p>• 2x Faster Load and Navigation Times</p>\n<p>Lightweight architecture and aggressive caching improved page load and navigation performance by up to 100%.</p>\n<p>• Unified Development Framework</p>\n<p>With a shared component library and mono-repo setup, Subscribili can now horizontally build internal and customer-facing apps using the same base utilities and UI. This significantly reduced their engineering overhead.</p>\n<p>• Frictionless Migration</p>\n<p>Legacy applications continued to operate seamlessly during migration through API versioning and adapters, ensuring zero downtime for users.</p>\n<p>• Future-Ready Platform</p>\n<p>Subscribili’s engineering team is now equipped to scale rapidly. They can launch new features, products, and customer experiences with ease, all from a unified architecture.</p>\n"},"clients":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"39","name":"Oral Genome","style":"dark-blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"37","name":"Subscribili","style":"dark-blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"36","name":"Music Distribution Company","style":"electricIndigo","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"35","name":"Global Record Label","style":"fullBlack","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"34","name":"Starz","style":"dark-blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"33","name":"FamilyCloud","style":"electricIndigo","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"32","name":"Redacted","style":"fullBlack","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"31","name":"Redacted","style":"pricebook-orange","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"30","name":"Redacted","style":"electricIndigo","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"29","name":"AGS","style":"red","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"28","name":"Redacted","style":"green","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"27","name":"Hotstar","style":"fullBlack","logo":"org/hotstar.png"}},{"node":{"id":"26","name":"Framework","style":"fullBlack","logo":"org/framework.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"25","name":"Routinr","style":"purple-blue","logo":"org/routinr.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"24","name":"eVisitNB","style":"red","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"23","name":"EquipmentFX","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"22","name":"Beatclub","style":"dark-grey","logo":"org/beatclub.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"21","name":"Social Lab","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"20","name":"IFAD","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"19","name":"10i Commerce","style":"dark-blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"18","name":"IDExcel","style":"grey","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"17","name":"Aisle","style":"green","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"16","name":"Trazaar","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"15","name":"Jiffle Now","style":"pink","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"14","name":"Farmstead","style":"green","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"13","name":"Inkl","style":"dark-blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"12","name":"Glydel","style":"grey","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"11","name":"Messaging Solution Provider","style":"black","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"10","name":"EAM360","style":"eam-blue","logo":"org/eam360.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"9","name":"TuneCore","style":"black","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"8","name":"Abridge","style":"orange","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"7","name":"GE Digital Services","style":"green","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"6","name":"Gaea Global","style":"red","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"5","name":"Genetic Direction","style":"dark-blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"4","name":"IDEO","style":"yellow","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"3","name":"Fankave","style":"black","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"2","name":"Caratlane","style":"blue","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"1","name":"Modus","style":"pink","logo":""}}]}},"context":{}}
