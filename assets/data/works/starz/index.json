But underwhelming IT support was slowing things down. The internal DevOps team was stuck solving routine issues instead of focusing on innovation. What they needed was a partner to re-architect their support system.</p>\n<h1 id=\"challenges\"><a href=\"#challenges\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Challenges</h1>\n<h2 id=\"lack-of-documentation\"><a href=\"#lack-of-documentation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Lack of documentation</h2>\n<p>No central knowledge base or runbooks meant onboarding and scaling support was slow and inconsistent.</p>\n<h2 id=\"247-coverage-needs\"><a href=\"#247-coverage-needs\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>24/7 coverage needs</h2>\n<p>Uptime expectations were sky-high.
