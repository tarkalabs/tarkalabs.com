Each store used a different authentication mechanism. In this article, we will take a look at different SFTP auth mechanisms and connect to them using Go.</p>\n<h1 id=\"method\"><a href=\"#method\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Method</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Install SSH Go Library</li>\n<li>Connect to SFTP via on of the below methods</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Password Authentication</li>\n<li>Keyfile Authentication</li>\n<li>Keyboard Interactive Authentication</li>\n<li>All in one</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"install-ssh-go-library\"><a href=\"#install-ssh-go-library\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Install SSH Go Library</h1>\n<p>As a first step, we need to install <code class=\"language-inline-text\">golang.org/x/crypto/ssh</code> library. We can install it manually using :</p>\n<p><code class=\"language-inline-text\">go get golang.org/x/crypto/ssh</code></p>\n<h1 id=\"password-authentication\"><a href=\"#password-authentication\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Password Authentication</h1>\n<p>Once the library is installed we are ready to authenticate using first possible method i.e. Password Authentication. Here’s the snippet for Password authentication for SFTP. Save this file as <code class=\"language-inline-text\">main.go</code></p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"golang\"><pre class=\"language-golang\"><code class=\"language-golang\">package main\nimport (\n  &quot;fmt&quot;\n  &quot;golang.org/x/crypto/ssh&quot;\n)\nfunc main() {\n  port := 22\n  hostname := &quot;hostname&quot;\n  password := &quot;password&quot;\n  user := &quot;user&quot;\n  addr := fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%s:%d&quot;, hostname, port)\n  config := ssh.ClientConfig{\n    User: user,\n    HostKeyCallback: ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey(),\n    Auth: []ssh.AuthMethod{\n      ssh.Password(password),\n    },\n  }\n  conn, err := ssh.Dial(&quot;tcp&quot;, addr, &amp;config)\n  if err != nil {\n    fmt.Println(&quot;Failed to connect to [%s]: %v&quot;, addr, err)\n    return\n  }\n  defer conn.Close()</code></pre></div>\n<h1 id=\"keyfile-authentication\"><a href=\"#keyfile-authentication\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Keyfile Authentication</h1>\n<p>Another widely used authentication method is Keyfile based authentication. Below is the code snippet for the same.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"golang\"><pre class=\"language-golang\"><code class=\"language-golang\">package main\nimport (\n  &quot;fmt&quot;\n  &quot;io/ioutil&quot;\n  &quot;golang.org/x/crypto/ssh&quot;\n)\nfunc main() {\n  port := 22\n  hostname := &quot;hostname&quot;\n  keypath := &quot;keypath&quot;\n  user := &quot;user&quot;\n  addr := fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%s:%d&quot;, hostname, port)\n  authMethod, _ := readPublicKey(keypath)\n  config := ssh.ClientConfig{\n    User: user,\n    HostKeyCallback: ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey(),\n    Auth: authMethod,\n  }\n  conn, err := ssh.Dial(&quot;tcp&quot;, addr, &amp;config)\n  if err != nil {\n    fmt.Println(&quot;Failed to connect to [%s]: %v&quot;, addr, err)\n    return\n  }\n  defer conn.Close()\n}\nfunc readPublicKey(keypath string) ([]ssh.AuthMethod, error){\n  pKeyBytes, err := ioutil.ReadFile(keypath)\n  if err != nil {\n    return nil, err\n  }\n  signer, err := ssh.ParsePrivateKey(pKeyBytes)\n  if err != nil {\n    return nil, err\n  }\n  return []ssh.AuthMethod{\n    ssh.PublicKeys(signer),\n  }, nil\n}</code></pre></div>\n<h1 id=\"keyboard-interactive-authentication\"><a href=\"#keyboard-interactive-authentication\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Keyboard Interactive Authentication</h1>\n<p>Almost all the SFTP servers we encountered used the above two auth mechanisms however we were not able to connect to two of our servers. They supported new authentication method Keyboard-Interactive (KBI). <strong>KBI authentication is the most recent form of authentication for SSH</strong>. It involves the server sending prompts to the client, to which the client must respond to correctly to be authenticated.</p>\n<p>The code snippet for <code class=\"language-inline-text\">authMethod</code> for KBI authentication is as below.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"golang\"><pre class=\"language-golang\"><code class=\"language-golang\">ssh.KeyboardInteractive(func(user, instruction string, questions []string, echos []bool) ([]string, error) {\n  answers := make([]string, len(questions))\n  for i, _ := range answers {\n    answers[i] = cs.Password\n  }\n  return answers, nil\n}),</code></pre></div>\n<h1 id=\"combining-all-methods\"><a href=\"#combining-all-methods\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Combining all methods</h1>\n<p>We could not find a way to figure out if a server supported KBI authentication or Password authentication, hence we used the <code class=\"language-inline-text\">array</code>functionality provided by Go SFTP library. It can take in an array of auth methods and try each one until one of them succeeds. The code snippet for the combination of all auth methods is as below.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"golang\"><pre class=\"language-golang\"><code class=\"language-golang\">package main\nimport (\n  &quot;fmt&quot;\n  &quot;io/ioutil&quot;\n  &quot;golang.org/x/crypto/ssh&quot;\n)\nfunc main() {\n  port := 22\n  hostname := &quot;hostname&quot;\n  keypath := &quot;keypath&quot;\n  password := &quot;password&quot;\n  user := &quot;user&quot;\n  addr := fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%s:%d&quot;, hostname, port)\n  publicKeyAuth, _ := readPublicKey(keypath)\n  config := ssh.ClientConfig{\n    User: user,\n    HostKeyCallback: ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey(),\n    Auth: []ssh.AuthMethod{\n      publicKeyAuth,\n      ssh.Password(password),\n      ssh.KeyboardInteractive(func(user, instruction string, questions []string, echos []bool) ([]string, error) {\n        answers := make([]string, len(questions))\n        for i, _ := range answers {\n          answers[i] = password\n        }\n        return answers, nil\n      }),\n    },\n  }\n  conn, err := ssh.Dial(&quot;tcp&quot;, addr, &amp;config)\n  if err != nil {\n    fmt.Println(&quot;Failed to connect to [%s]: %v&quot;, addr, err)\n    return\n  }\n  defer conn.Close()\n}\nfunc readPublicKey(keypath string) (ssh.AuthMethod, error){\n  pKeyBytes, err := ioutil.ReadFile(keypath)\n  if err != nil {\n    return nil, err\n  }\n  signer, err := ssh.ParsePrivateKey(pKeyBytes)\n  if err != nil {\n    return nil, err\n  }\n  return ssh.PublicKeys(signer), nil</code></pre></div>\n<p>Finally, we can run this program using <code class=\"language-inline-text\">go run main</code>.</p>\n<p>That’s all, folks!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello Montreal!
