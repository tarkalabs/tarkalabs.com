I know it’s sounds cliched, but it’s true.</p>\n<p>But learning a new tech stack or a database or a language can be daunting. You might run into errors while setting up the environment, you might not understand some concepts, you might have some questions which Google or StackOverflow can’t answer. There are a myriad of difficulties in the learning process, each depleting your motivation.</p>\n<p>What if I told you there is a way where you would not only learn things that you set out to learn but also, meet like minded people, have your doubts cleared by experienced folks and maybe even earn some money?</p>\n<p>Enter Twitch.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"/blog/learn-youtube-video/rahul-blog-2.webp\" alt=\"You just need one machine to stream 😝\"><figcaption>You just need one machine to stream 😝</figcaption></figure>\n<p>For people who might have heard of this platform might know it, as a game streaming service, but did you know there is a <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/science-and-technology\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Science and Technology</a> section where people live code? You can find people streaming their journey of developing a video game, or someone developing a web service, or someone learning a new language or framework, or someone preparing for their tech interviews. Though it is diverse, there aren’t a lot of people watching these streams mainly because Twitch is popular in the gaming community. But it’s changing, and according to me it’s going to explode in the next 2 -3 years.</p>\n<p>If you plan on learning something new, I would recommend you stream it on twitch. There are people who would drop by and help you out on things that i mentioned earlier. Eventually, you would start gaining some following and if you are lucky you might start making some side cash. But money is the by product of streaming, the important thing is you would learn what you wanted to learn. Streaming, won’t help in easing the learning process but surely would speed it up.</p>\n<p>Ready to start? There are a ton of articles like this which would help you get started with OBS, setting up alerts, streaming equipment etc. (believe me it’s much easier than vertically aligning a div 😆).</p>\n<p>Some people who I follow on twitch -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>CodingGarden : <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/codinggarden\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener
