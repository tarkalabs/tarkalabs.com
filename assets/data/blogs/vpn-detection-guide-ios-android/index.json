Once the data packets reach the server, they are decrypted and forwarded to their destination on the internet.</p>\n<h1 id=\"why-do-some-service-providers-disallow-vpn-use\"><a href=\"#why-do-some-service-providers-disallow-vpn-use\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Why do some service providers disallow VPN Use?</h1>\n<p>The reasons may vary.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Banks may block VPN connections due to security concerns since they can hide a user’s IP address and encrypt their traffic, which cybercriminals normally use to evade detection.</li>\n<li>OTTs often ban VPNs use due to regional content licensing agreements, varying government laws, and censorship. VPNs can help users bypass content restrictions, leading to legal and ethical concerns for OTTs.</li>\n<li>To prevent users from subscribing from countries where the subscriptions are cheaper.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"how-can-we-detect-vpn-usage\"><a href=\"#how-can-we-detect-vpn-usage\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>How can we detect VPN Usage?</h1>\n<p>VPN use can be detected both on the server and client sides. Let’s first explore how VPN detection can be done on the server side:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check against a list of <a href=\"https://github.com/X4BNet/lists_vpn/blob/main/output/vpn/ipv4.txt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">public</a> / paid VPN Servers IP addresses.</li>\n<li>Analyze the incoming traffic. If you can find a large number of users with the same IP address, then it’s probably a VPN server.</li>\n<li>GeoIP tracking — the user’s location and last login date is analyzed. If there is an unrealistic change in the user’s location in an unrealistic timeframe, it could indicate VPN usage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>VPN detection on the client side is more straightforward since the data is encrypted on the client side using a tunneling protocol. On the client side, you can check the Network Proxy settings to check if any tunneling protocols are being used.</p>\n<h1 id=\"how-to-detect-vpn-usage-in-ios-swift\"><a href=\"#how-to-detect-vpn-usage-in-ios-swift\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>How to detect VPN usage in iOS (Swift)</h1>\n<p>By reading the network proxy settings, you can manually check if tunneling protocols are used.
