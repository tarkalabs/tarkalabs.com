Most of my colleagues are not in the same place and we get to work on different projects based on the need, skills and interests of the individuals. That means, we need to have an effective way to pair program. We don’t do pair programming as a rule but to deal with complex stories and exchange implementation ideas. We also find pairing to be an effective mechanism to onboard new developers into the project</p>\n<p>So, how do we do that? What tools do we use? Of course there are tons of options out there to screen share (Slack, Google Meet, Skype, etc) but when it comes to remote controlling other developer’s screen, there are not many. We found a setup that works well with low latency and I would like to share it here.</p>\n<h1 id=\"tldr\"><a href=\"#tldr\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>TL;DR</h1>\n<p>Use Mac screen sharing with ngrok tcp tunnel opened in your region (for minimal network latency). Read on if you want to know how to do it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"setup\"><a href=\"#setup\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Setup</h1>\n<p>Suppose you wanted to share your desktop with your pair, do the following in your mac</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enable “Remote Management”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Enabling remote management in your mac allows other machines to connect to your machine via the default port 5900</p>\n<img src=\"/blog/remote-pairing/remote-pairing-2.webp\">\n<p>Also click on <em>“Computer Settings…”</em> and enable “Anyone may request permission to control screen”. This makes it easy for your pair to simply request permission instead of you sharing your login username and password.</p>\n<img src=\"/blog/remote-pairing/remote-pairing-3.webp\">\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Start ngrok</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://ngrok.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ngrok</a> is a very interesting tool to expose your local ports securely to the outside world. If you have not used it before, head <a href=\"https://ngrok.com/product\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a> to set it up in your machine and play around. It should not take more than 5 mins to see it in action</p>\n<p>Once you have ngrok command line tool in your mac, Run the following command</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ngrok tcp -region ap 5900</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We are exposing the tcp port 5900 via ngrok. The -region option is used to pick the ngrok server in Asia Pacific (one closer to me) so that there is lesser network latency. Once you run the above command, you should see the output with a line similar to one below</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Forwarding tcp://0.tcp.ap.ngrok.io:17825 -> localhost:5900</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the hostname with which your pair can connect to your machine</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Ask your pair to connect</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Share the hostname and port (0.tcp.ap.ngrok.io:17825 in the above example) to your pair and ask him to open the “Screen Sharing” app and enter it</p>\n<img src=\"/blog/remote-pairing/remote-pairing-4.webp\">\n<p>Then you will be shown the below screen so that you can “Request permission”</p>\n<img src=\"/blog/remote-pairing/remote-pairing-5.webp\">\n<p>Once your pair clicks on connect, you will see a popup requesting you to grant permission to this new connection. Once you allow it, your pair can start controlling the machine with his mouse and keyboard.</p>\n<p>Happy Remote Pairing!</p>\n"},"blogs":{"edges":[{"node":{"tag":"web","title":"Using Tarka Chat in
