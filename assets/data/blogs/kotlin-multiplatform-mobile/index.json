We could not create an Instance object from epoch milliseconds on the iOS side as the tooling had stripped the required constructor function. The recommended solution is to export the library, but this might increase the compilation time and the binary size.

To solve this we used <a href=\"https://github.com/rickclephas/KMP-NativeCoroutines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">KMP-NativeCoroutines</a> that converts Kotlin Coroutine to swift equivalents i.e. async-await or Combine.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like all cross-platform frameworks, KMM has its pros and cons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It took a significant amount of time and effort to set up initially. When compared to other cross-platform mobile frameworks, community support is not very substantial, and there are no established guidelines for project architecture or design. However, with a collaborative and cross-functional team, we were able to share much of the business logic using proper abstractions.</p>\n<p>KMM’s performance is comparable to that of a native app, and the development experience for Android developers is similar to that of developing a native Android app, though it may be unfamiliar to iOS developers at first.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>As a relatively new framework, the tooling, community, and best practices around KMM are not yet well-developed. Nonetheless, as more developers and companies adopt KMM, these areas are expected to improve.</p>\n<p>KMM can be a good fit if the mobile development team is cross-functional and exposed to Android and iOS. Also, expertise in Android is required as the tooling and the ecosystem is very similar to native Android development.
