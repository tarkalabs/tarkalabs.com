We realized that the decision to adopt Algolia search came a few years back, and we have never looked at the competition that came afterward.</p>\n<p>So, being the cutting edge techies that we are, we started looking into other modern options in the database search domain that provided similar or better features, hopefully with a lower operational cost.</p>\n<p>This is when we stumbled upon <a href=\"https://typesense.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Typesense</a>, an open source alternative for Algolia search, which works similarly. This article gives a brief peek into the changes we made for moving to Typesense as our search service.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-exactly-is-typesense\"><a href=\"#what-exactly-is-typesense\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What exactly is Typesense?</h1>\n<p>In May 2023, if you haven’t heard about Typesense, it is not surprising. Sure, it’s younger and less popular (maybe?) than Algolia search. But on the other hand, it is open-source, has a cheaper cloud option and can be self-hosted if you have the hardware to spare. More than that, it is packed with all the features that Algolia provides, if not more.</p>\n<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: Their website has a <a href=\"https://typesense.org/typesense-vs-algolia-vs-elasticsearch-vs-meilisearch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">dedicated page</a> for comparison against Algolia, ElasticSearch and Meilisearch.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-algolia-based-architecture\"><a href=\"#the-algolia-based-architecture\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The Algolia-based architecture</h1>\n<p>Before going through the changes that we made, let’s have an understanding of how Algolia was integrated into our application.</p>\n<p>We had an MVC code structure set up, with a lot of helper files and service files. Our search-related functionalities were defined in an <strong><em>algolia-client.js</em></strong> file. If you ignore the unrelated logic and complexities, our controller looked similar to this:</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code

then used by 3 methods to provide search, add and update functionalities, which were exported for use in the controller.

But Typesense recommends pre-defining the schema for records that are going to be stored in a collection. In the schema, we can specify which fields need to be indexed or sorted, and which fields are optional, etc. We can also ask a field type to be automatically inferred by setting the type property as <strong><em>auto</em></strong>. An example schema would be:</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token constant\">COLLECTION_SCHEMA</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">name</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"id\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">type</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"string\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">index</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">name</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"data\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">type</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"object\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">index</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">name</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"optional_info\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">type</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"auto\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">index</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">optional</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">name</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"created_at\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">type</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"string\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">index</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">sort</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>We had a good idea about some of the top-level fields in our collection. So, we stuck with a predefined schema, and set <strong><em>type: object</em></strong> for some of the fields which were objects with no set structure.</p>\n<p>If we did not want to pre-define a schema, we would have defined the schema using a wildcard name and auto type as follows.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token constant\">COLLECTION_SCHEMA</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">name</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\".*\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">type</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"auto\"</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Moving on, setting up the collection looked like this.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\">client\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">collections</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">create</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token literal-property property\">name</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token constant\">COLLECTION_NAME</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token literal-property property\">enable_nested_fields</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token literal-property property\">fields</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token constant\">COLLECTION_SCHEMA</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">catch</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">err</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> err<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> collection <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> client<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">collections</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token constant\">COLLECTION_NAME</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://typesense.org/docs/0.24.0/api/collections.html#create-a-collection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Collections section</a> in the docs for a more in-depth description of collections.</p>\n<p><strong>Typesense’s collection is similar to an Algolia index</strong></p>\n<p>Typesense collections are similar to Algolia indices in a way.
