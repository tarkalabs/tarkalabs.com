pipeline in Rust.\nWe wanted to execute asynchronous tasks in response to messages received from SQS, as a subscriber.\nOur goal was to leverage Rust generics to allow the subscriber to take ownership of the payload schema and the pipeline implementation details.\nThis approach enables the separation of the SQS subscription logic from the subscriber’s responsibilities, promoting of cleaner separation of concerns.\nIt also facilitates independent testing of both components, ensuring they can be assessed in isolation.</p>\n<p>Here’s what we came up with :</p>\n<div
