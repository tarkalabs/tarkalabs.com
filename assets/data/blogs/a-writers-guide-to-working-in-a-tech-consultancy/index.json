Here’s how you, as a non-tech person, can do it with some style.</p>\n<p>I’m a writer who has worked in IT organizations all my career. On any collaboration day, 90% of the time, I interact with technical folks — from freshers, all the way up to CEOs and CTOs. My specialization is writing to persuade stakeholders or make technical information engaging to casual readers.</p>\n<p>As you can imagine, one of the most valuable things I’ve learned in this past decade is how to navigate rooms full of people who will know more about technology than I ever will. And more importantly, coax them into revealing critical information that will enable me to do my job.</p>\n<p>I’m writing down my learning here to ease the way for other folks who work in cross-functional teams/roles.</p>\n<h1 id=\"this-is-a-learning-opportunity\"><a href=\"#this-is-a-learning-opportunity\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>This is a learning opportunity</h1>\n<p>Usually, when I have access to tech folks, I treat it as a learning opportunity, and I approach it as such. I am fully present in conversations because I am trying to interpret this technical knowledge through my lens (that of a writer) and actively listening.</p>\n<p>When I joined Tarka, I spent most of my first month on calls with every single person on the team to get to know them. I ended up having some brilliant conversations!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Conversations accelerate learning more than individual research.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"channel-your-inner-toddler\"><a href=\"#channel-your-inner-toddler\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Channel your inner toddler</h1>\n<p>Chances are, you’ve been around a little human who incessantly asks questions. When I am in such tech-heavy rooms, I take inspiration from my toddler and quiz people. Ask about them, what they do, and the basics of the topic (NOTE: There are no stupid questions, but don’t be <a href=\"https://letmegooglethat.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this person</a>.) So, I make it a point to prep and write down questions I want to ask them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Prep for SME interviews like your salary depends on it. :P</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"think-of-yourself-as-a-reporter\"><a href=\"#think-of-yourself-as-a-reporter\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Think of yourself as a reporter</h1>\n<p>Interviewing is a skill. One that can be learned. Here are some great resources that teach you those skills right now. Take a gander <a href=\"http://www.columbia.edu/itc/journalism/isaacs/edit/MencherIntv1.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://journalistsresource.org/home/interviewing-a-source/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-makes-a-great-interview-malcolm-gladwells-7-tips-for-interviewing-journalistic-sources\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>One thing I unfailing do is — at strategic intervals, I try to repeat what I’ve understood back to the person I’m conversing with. It’s a great way to test my understanding and reveal incorrect assumptions (again, proceed with mindfulness, read the room).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Use that tech. Recording your conversation (with consent) frees you from note-taking and enables active listening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"accept-your-limitations\"><a href=\"#accept-your-limitations\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Accept your limitations</h1>\n<p>That doesn’t mean you cannot learn new things. It’s just that you don’t need to know everything in-depth! I sometimes feel like a fraud when I write about tech stuff (hello, imposter syndrome!). But I’ve since realized that there is absolutely a place and a need for the larger picture.</p>\n<p>The context is where the story lives.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"/blog/a-writers-guide-to-working-in-a-tech-consultancy/inception.png\" alt=\"Without context, Inception is just a bunch of ppl taking naps.\"><figcaption>Without context, Inception is just a bunch of ppl taking naps.</figcaption></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"/blog/a-writers-guide-to-working-in-a-tech-consultancy/train.gif\" alt=\"That train scene was iconic! If you think about it, they never really explained how this tech works. 🤔\"><figcaption>That train scene was iconic! If you think about it, they never really explained how this tech works. 🤔</figcaption></figure>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Context reveals commonalities, human frailties, and unexpected consequences and is deeply satisfying when you make the connections.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1 id=\"taking-on-imposter-syndrome\"><a href=\"#taking-on-imposter-syndrome\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Taking on imposter syndrome</h1>\n<p>This one has been a specter following me around as I rise through the ranks. Here are a few things I say to quiet that negative voice in my head.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are an expert in something. Your perspective and unique knowledge are your superpowers. None of the others in your room have lived your life or worked on your projects. That is what you contribute, a fresh perspective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, I have access to this room for a reason. I wouldn’t be there if folks didn’t believe I could contribute meaningfully.</p>\n<p>And that’s it, folks. I hope you all get some good out of it.</p>\n<p>What soft skills have you built to thrive in cross-functional teams?</p>\n"},"blogs":{"edges":[{"node":{"tag":"careers","title":"A Marketer's Guide to
