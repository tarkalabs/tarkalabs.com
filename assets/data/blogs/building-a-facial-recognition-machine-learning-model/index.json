I was instantly hooked, and keenly listened to everyone talking about it.</p>\n<p>Someone brought up the TV series ‚Äú<strong><em>Person of Interest</em></strong>‚Äù ‚Äî a sci-fi crime drama, which is actually based on AI. This intrigued me, and made me want to explore more.</p>\n<p>Here is the story-line of the TV series ‚Äî a computer programmer develops an application for the government that is capable of collating all sources of information to predict and identify people planning terrorist acts. Based on the predicted information, he tries to stop the crime.</p>\n<p>How? ‚Äî The entire city‚Äôs surveillance data feed would be given to the system as input. The machine would collate the relevant information by analysing the video feed, and learn the pattern that occurred in every crime activity.</p>\n<p>Cut to a few days later, I came across an interesting project called <a href=\"https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Facenet</strong></a>. This project deals with Face recognition ‚Äì <em>a computer vision task of identifying and verifying a person based on a photograph of their face.</em></p>\n<p>After going through the details of this project, <em>I could relate it with the Person Of Interest TV series</em>. I attempted to build the same thing, but by adding my own person of interest image set into the project.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The process of adding a small dataset with a pre-trained model and performing retraining is called <strong>Transfer Learning</strong>. It is much faster and extremely cost-effective because all the learnings are already done. Adding a new dataset on top of it is just a small effort of learning which will be faster and cost-effective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this post, I will share my experience building the project, and creating the ML model.</p>\n<p>Before we dive into building the model, let us understand the steps involved in the building process.</p>\n<p>To build a machine learning model, we need data and it has to undergo the following steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, the raw data needs to be curated, cleaned and organised as a dataset. In our case, it‚Äôs the set of images of each person. Generally this will be done with the help of data scientists and domain experts.</li>\n<li>Second, the dataset needs to be split into two. Training dataset (80%) and Test dataset (20%)</li>\n<li>Third, we write our own algorithm or choose an existing machine learning algorithm which is the best fit for our usecase.</li>\n<li>Lastly, we need to do the training by adjusting the input values till we get the expected accuracy level.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, it‚Äôs time to dive deep, into the hands-on üôÉ</p>\n<p>I forked the <a href=\"https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Facenet</strong></a> project into my Github account to do my experiments. Also, I containerised it using <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Docker</strong></a> for the faster start up and easier management. These two steps are of course optional, but I found that it made things very convenient for me.</p>\n<p>Once this is done, here is how you too can go about building your version of this application:</p>\n<h1 id=\"setting-up-the-work-environment\"><a href=\"#setting-up-the-work-environment\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Setting up the Work Environment</h1>\n<p>Ensure that Git and Docker installed on your machine.</p>\n<p>Open the terminal and clone the project into you workspace</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">$ <span class=\"token function\">git</span> clone https://github.com/rajivmanivannan/facenet\n$ <span class=\"token builtin class-name\">cd</span> facenet</code></pre></div>\n<p>Use the below docker compose command to build the docker image.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">$ <span class=\"token function\">docker-compose</span> build</code></pre></div>\n<figure><img src=\"/blog/building-a-facial-recognition-machine-learning-model/2.webp\" alt=\"Docker image build successfully\"><figcaption>Docker image build successfully</figcaption></figure>\n<p>To run the dockerized application execute the below command</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">$ <span class=\"token function\">docker-compose</span> run <span class=\"token parameter variable\">--rm</span> cli <span class=\"token function\">bash</span></code></pre></div>\n<figure><img src=\"/blog/building-a-facial-recognition-machine-learning-model/3.webp\" alt=\"Docker image started and running\"><figcaption>Docker image started and running</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Run the below commands to create required directory for our work.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">$ <span class=\"token function\">mkdir</span> models <span class=\"token function\">mkdir</span> <span class=\"token parameter variable\">-p</span> datasets/lfw/raw <span class=\"token function\">mkdir</span> <span class=\"token parameter variable\">-p</span>\ndatasets/my_dataset/<span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>train,test<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<img src=\"/blog/building-a-facial-recognition-machine-learning-model/4.webp\">\n<h1 id=\"step1--collecting-data-and-creating-dataset\"><a href=\"#step1--collecting-data-and-creating-dataset\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Step1 : Collecting data and creating dataset</h1>\n<p>I collected images of myself and one celebrity from internet.
