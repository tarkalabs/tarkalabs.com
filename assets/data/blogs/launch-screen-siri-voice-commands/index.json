I first considered using Intent and App extensions, which would require more effort to develop. Subsequently, I discovered that consolidating with NSUserActivity and IntentsUI is a piece of cake to open a specific app screen. Intent can increase interaction between Siri and your app, which is unnecessary in our case.</p>\n<p>Let’s explore how easy it is to launch a specific screen using the Siri voice command.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting the voice phrase in NSUserActivity. (<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsuseractivity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">NSUserActivity</a> is the object used to coordinate interactions between your app and Siri)</li>\n<li>Connecting that to <strong>INUIAddVoiceShortcutViewController</strong> (a class file that helps to add a shortcut to Siri) in the screen which you wish to open</li>\n<li>Navigation action</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"add-shortcut-viewcontroller-using-the-intentsui-framework\"><a href=\"#add-shortcut-viewcontroller-using-the-intentsui-framework\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Add Shortcut ViewController using the IntentsUI framework:</h1>\n<p>We’ll provide the default phrase “Show nearby assets” in this example to tell SIRI to launch the screen that shows the nearby Assets. To achieve this, we’ll have to use the delegate methods provided by <strong>INUIAddVoiceShortcutViewControllerDelegate</strong>. Please refer screenshot below. However, in iOS 15, there is an option to remove the shortcut and change the phrase directly from the view if desired.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n    <img src=\"/blog/launch-screen-siri-voice-commands/siri-config.webp\" style=\"width:300px;\"/>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"configuring-error-messages\"><a href=\"#configuring-error-messages\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Configuring error messages</h1>\n<p>A method addVoiceShortcutViewController(_:didFinishWith:error:)will be called once the <strong>Done</strong> button is clicked. This is used to dismiss the AddVoiceShortcutViewController and display any error that has occurred. So, once you’ve added the shortcut, you can dismiss the view by hitting the Done button.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"swift\"><pre class=\"language-swift\"><code class=\"language-swift\"><span class=\"token keyword\">class</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">SecondViewController</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">INUIAddVoiceShortcutViewControllerDelegate</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">override</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">func</span> <span class=\"token function-definition function\">viewDidLoad</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">super</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">viewDidLoad</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n <span class=\"token keyword\">func</span> <span class=\"token function-definition function\">addVoiceShortcutViewControllerDidCancel</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token omit keyword\">_</span> controller<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">INUIAddVoiceShortcutViewController</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">dismiss</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>animated<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> completion<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token nil constant\">nil</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">func</span> <span class=\"token function-definition function\">addVoiceShortcutViewController</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token omit keyword\">_</span> controller<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">INUIAddVoiceShortcutViewController</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> didFinishWith voiceShortcut<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">INVoiceShortcut</span><span class=\"token operator\">?</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> error<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Error</span><span class=\"token operator\">?</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">dismiss</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>animated<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> completion<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token nil constant\">nil</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>A set of delegate methods that will be called when the done and cancel buttons are pressed.</p>\n<h1 id=\"set-the-suggestion-phrase-and-title-in-nsuseractivity\"><a href=\"#set-the-suggestion-phrase-and-title-in-nsuseractivity\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Set the suggestion phrase and title in NSUserActivity:</h1>\n<p>We have to provide the suggested shortcut phrase by using <code class=\"language-inline-text\">suggestedInvocationPhrase</code> in NSUserActivity.
