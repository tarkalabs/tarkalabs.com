Couple of most commonly used ways are to the Heroku or your own VPS. The former promises to save time over money and latter the reverse.</p>\n<p>As you might know, <a href=\"https://www.heroku.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Heroku</a>, a PaaS, is known for making deployment as seamless as possible. Git push into your Heroku app and you’re done. Whereas deploying to your own VPS is cheap and offers you customization, but involves a complicated process to get it up and running.</p>\n<p>What if you could get the simplicity of the deployment that Heroku offers and the freedom from your own servers? <a href=\"http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">dokku</a> aims to be the answer.</p>\n<p>In this post, we’ll see how to deploy an example Rails application to dokku.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-is-dokku\"><a href=\"#what-is-dokku\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What is dokku?</h1>\n<p>dokku is a PaaS implementation. Or much rather, an open source Heroku. So it’ll be like any other software that you install on your server to immediately grant it capabilities of a Platform. Since dokku is also a small implementation, you wouldn’t have much trouble using it in small servers.</p>\n<p>Apart from its small implementation, dokku is also easy to extend and has support for many platforms for easy integrations. Stuff like adding SSL, notifications, auto-deployments are all easy to achieve in dokku. We’ll cover each of these individually in upcoming posts.</p>\n<h1 id=\"initializing-the-app\"><a href=\"#initializing-the-app\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Initializing the app</h1>\n<p>Let’s now setup an example Rails app for us to deploy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you have an existing Rails app that you would like to follow this tutorial with, you can safely ignore this section.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We’re using the following versions for our sample app.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"rb\"><pre class=\"language-rb\"><code class=\"language-rb\">Rails<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">6.0</span><span class=\"token number\">.32</span> Ruby<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">2.7</span><span class=\"token number\">.1</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Let’s initialize our Rails application with the following commands.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"rb\"><pre class=\"language-rb\"><code class=\"language-rb\">rails <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> dokku<span class=\"token operator\">-</span>rails <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token operator\">-</span>git <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token operator\">-</span>database<span class=\"token operator\">=</span>postgresql cd dokku<span class=\"token operator\">-</span>rails rake db<span class=\"token symbol\">:create</span> <span class=\"token operator\">&amp;&amp;</span> rake db<span class=\"token symbol\">:migrate</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>And let’s add some content to our landing page.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"rb\"><pre class=\"language-rb\"><code class=\"language-rb\"><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>h1<span class=\"token operator\">></span>hello world<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>h1<span class=\"token operator\">></span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>p<span class=\"token operator\">></span>Happy to say the mission is success<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>p<span class=\"token operator\">></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>and, we’ll make it the default page as well.

Quickly verify everything’s right by starting your rails server and visiting <code class=\"language-inline-text\">[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)</code></p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"rb\"><pre class=\"language-rb\"><code class=\"language-rb\">rails server</code></pre></div>\n<p>Let’s wrap things up by adding a git commit.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"</code></pre></div>\n<h1 id=\"installing-dokku-on-your-server\"><a href=\"#installing-dokku-on-your-server\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Installing dokku on your server</h1>\n<p>Before we integrate dokku into our application, we’ll setup dokku on our server first. I’m using <a href=\"https://www.hetzner.com/cloud\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Hetzner</a> for this exercise, but you can use a VPS provider of your choice. I’m provisioning a Ubuntu 20.0 server, but the instructions should be the same for most latest versions of Linux OS.</p>\n<img src=\"/blog/how-to-deploy-rails-application-with-dokku/1.webp\">\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before we start setting up, make sure to setup a deploy user to avoid using root user for deployments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After you SSH into your server, let’s start by installing dokku.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dokku/dokku/v0.21.3/bootstrap.sh;\nsudo DOKKU_TAG=v0.21.3 bash bootstrap.sh</code></pre></div>\n<p>This will install the <code class=\"language-inline-text\">0.21.3</code> version of dokku and its dependencies on your server.</p>\n<p>Once the installation is completed, head over to the dokku web admin by visiting http://&#x3C;your-server-ip> to do a one-time configuration for your app. This is an important step to setup VHOST configurations and only after you set it up, will the web admin be stopped. Not doing it will cause the web-admin to continue existing and vulnerable.</p>\n<img src=\"/blog/how-to-deploy-rails-application-with-dokku/2.webp\">\n<p>The instructions are pretty straightforward here. What you have to do is, upload your local ssh public key which you can fetch using <code class=\"language-inline-text\">cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> and set a host name. As you can see, I have selected the virtualhost and this is mostly preferential. If turned on, dokku will expose the apps via different port, else it'll be a subdomain based host.</p>\n<p>All of these settings are changeable later, so don't worry if you made a mistake.</p>\n<p>Now, dokku’s setup. Let’s get started with integrating into our application.</p>\n<h1 id=\"integration-with-the-app\"><a href=\"#integration-with-the-app\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Integration with the app</h1>\n<p>Let’s create our dokku app on the server. SSH into your server, and run the following commands.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">dokku apps:create dorails\nsudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-postgres.git\ndokku postgres:create dorails_db\ndokku postgres:link dorails_db dorails</code></pre></div>\n<p>We first start by creating the application in dokku. This will internally create appropriate Docker container and provision volumes and more for our application.</p>\n<p>In the second step, we’re adding “backing services” for our application. For our sample app Postgres database is the only backing service we use. The dokku postgres plugin will take care of installing postgres and setting up the db users for us to use later.</p>\n<p>The third step is where we’re creating the database to use in our application. You can specify any name you like, just make sure the database does not exist.</p>\n<p>And in the final step, we link the created database with our application. This will essentially set a <code class=\"language-inline-text\">DATABASE_URL</code> environment variable which will be picked up by Rails to connect to the database.</p>\n<p>At the end of the last command, you’ll see a warning.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">! App dorails has not been deployed</code></pre></div>\n<p>Let’s fix that.</p>\n<p>First, switch to your local shell and <code class=\"language-inline-text\">cd</code> into your project directory.</p>\n<p>We’ll first have to create a <code class=\"language-inline-text\">Procfile</code> in our application. Procfile is the manifest for our application that instructs dokku on the commands it has to execute to start our application and other services. Go to your project directory and create the <code class=\"language-inline-text\">Procfile</code> at the root.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">touch Procfile</code></pre></div>\n<p>and add the below content to the file.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"rb\"><pre class=\"language-rb\"><code class=\"language-rb\">web<span class=\"token operator\">:</span> bundle exec puma <span class=\"token operator\">-</span><span class=\"token constant\">C</span> config<span class=\"token operator\">/</span>puma<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>rb</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here, we have declared a “web” service that will be started by running the declared command. In future posts, we’ll look into integrating other services. For now, we’ll stick with the web service. We’ll do a git commit now.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git add . git commit -m \"Add Procfile\"</code></pre></div>\n<p>Let’s now add our dokku server as a git remote so that we can push the app and do our first deployment!</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git remote add dokku dokku@&lt;server-ip>:dorails</code></pre></div>\n<p>Replace <code class=\"language-inline-text\">&lt;server-ip></code> with your public IP of the server and the application name with the dokku app name you created in the previous step. Once added, kickstart your first deployment.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">git push dokku master</code></pre></div>\n<p>Once the installation is completed, head over to your server’s IP address and voila.</p>\n<img src=\"/blog/how-to-deploy-rails-application-with-dokku/3.webp\">\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>That brings us to the conclusion of this post. We have now successfully deployed our Rails application to the internet using dokku. Anytime you make changes to your application, deployment is as easy as git add &#x26; git push to your dokku.</p>\n<p>In future posts, we’ll look into adding custom domains for our dokku app, provisioning a SSL certificate and also explore some of dokku’s plugins.</p>\n<p>Originally published at <a href=\"http://codethumbs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener
