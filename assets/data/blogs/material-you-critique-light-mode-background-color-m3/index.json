Ask any new designer about systems in an interview, and you’re almost certain to hear mention of Material Design. Naturally, all eyes were on Google when they <a href=\"https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">unveiled “Material You,”</a> a major update to their seminal design system last May. The headline feature was the new color system, including Dynamic color. Well, we’ve been playing around with the new color system and we have some thoughts.</p>\n<p>I’d like to acknowledge right off the bat that color is tough to do well, especially when you start switching dynamically between light and dark modes. The Material team at Google has done some fantastic stuff, and I want to recognize that. The procedural generation of palettes for Dynamic color, the introduction of design tokens (that’s a topic for another blog post), and role-based color usage are all fantastic concepts, and I have massive respect for their team.</p>\n<p>There’s more we could talk about, but I want to focus today on one big wrench in the works.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Drum roll…</em></strong></p>\n<p>Light mode background color!</p>\n<p>That’s right, today we’re gonna roll up our sleeves and get specific and nit-picky.</p>\n<h1 id=\"making-sense-of-the-material-world\"><a href=\"#making-sense-of-the-material-world\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Making sense of the material world</h1>\n<p>The critical concept of the original Material Design is right in the name — Material. The entire system was built around the first-principles concept of interface elements as materials in a real-world environment complete with lighting. It really enabled designers to apply <em>logic</em> to their designs, even down to the way things moved. This new rationalized mental model lent itself very well to one of the most fundamental design concepts — hierarchy. Hierarchy is how we guide users through an interface, helping them parse information quickly, accurately, and in the correct order.</p>\n<p>Let’s illustrate this with the simple example of a modal (also commonly called a pop-up). Think about what happens when a modal appears in an interface. The background is usually dimmed with a ~60% black <a href=\"https://material.io/design/environment/surfaces.html#attributes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">scrim</a>. You then see a white rectangle (in light mode) appear on top of the scrim with some text content and a few buttons. It’s exceedingly clear what you’re supposed to focus on because the modal is on top of everything else, or in other words, it’s coming <em>forward</em> toward the user. <em>Hey, look at the bright thing!</em> The modal also has its own nested hierarchy, with some elements grabbing more attention than others.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"/blog/material-you-critique-light-mode-background-color-m3/1.webp\" alt=\"A wild modal appeared! Just kidding, this is a captive modal that I trapped for this post. Sorry for lying to you.\"><figcaption>A wild modal appeared! Just kidding, this is a captive modal that I trapped for this post. Sorry for lying to you.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In Material Design, the modal background is a bright surface for a good reason. It’s elevated above the rest of the content and therefore closer to imaginary light. Makes a lot of sense. Bright things in the UI tend to appear closer to you, and darker things push back away from the viewer. All good here — my expectations are intact.</p>\n<h1 id=\"can-we-skip-to-the-bad-part\"><a href=\"#can-we-skip-to-the-bad-part\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Can we skip to the bad part?</h1>\n<p>Okay, now that the background and hedging are out of the way, let’s get to that criticism I promised!</p>\n<p>The Material Design 3 (M3) color system takes this fundamental concept and…well, completely turns it on its head (but only for light mode!?). Let me show you an example. For this, we’ll use an exceedingly common UI pattern that shows up in all of our projects — the classic stepper flow.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"/blog/material-you-critique-light-mode-background-color-m3/2.webp\" alt=\"Light mode UI made with stock M3 color.\"><figcaption>Light mode UI made with stock M3 color.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>This screenshot was made using a color palette generated by <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1034969338659738588/Material-Theme-Builder\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Google’s Material Theme Builder plugin</a>. We were careful to implement the colors as closely as possible to Google’s intent. This is, in our opinion, not so good.</p>\n<p>See how the background is light, and the surfaces are darker? This goes completely against what I explained before. The surfaces are supposed to be at a higher elevation than the background, which would put them closer to our imaginary light. Those input fields aren’t looking too hot either. Usually, we try to <em>punch out</em> the input fields in the surface to make them look like they’re sunken in a bit. This anchors them nicely and makes it feel like you’re putting text into a container that’s going to hold on to it. The fields in the example just look sort of muddy and bad. My eyes don’t <em>snap</em> to them as focal points at all. Sure, the fact that the surfaces have a color tint to them is kind of a nice thing if you consider that in isolation, but it’s not worth it. 3/10 — would not use.</p>\n<p>While we’re at it, let’s take a quick peek at dark mode.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"/blog/material-you-critique-light-mode-background-color-m3/3.webp\" alt=\"Dark mode UI made with stock M3 color.\"><figcaption>Dark mode UI made with stock M3 color.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Oh? What do we have here? The relationship between surface and background is back to normal! My eyes are much happier with this. Hold on a second though — why is this relationship inverted between the two modes? This breaks the logic that was so fundamental to the older versions of Material Design. What about the input fields? Maybe a bit better, but still not working so well in my opinion. 5/10 — still would not use.</p>\n<p>Ok Google, we’re not saying you’re wrong quite yet. What if we just make some tweaks? We’re not going to stray far, but let’s see if we can polish this up a bit.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"/blog/material-you-critique-light-mode-background-color-m3/4.webp\" alt=\"Our attempt at fixing some things — light mode.\"><figcaption>Our attempt at fixing some things — light mode.</figcaption></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"/blog/material-you-critique-light-mode-background-color-m3/5.webp\" alt=\"Our attempt at fixing some things — dark mode.\"><figcaption>Our attempt at fixing some things — dark mode.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Ahhh, those input fields are looking much better now, right? Now the fields are “sunken into” the material they’re sitting on top of instead of floating mushily. That light mode background/surface relationship is still causing me pain though. We’re not there yet.</p>\n<p><em>A few hours and a few team discussions later…</em></p>\n<p>Well, we gave it our best shot, but we always ended up back at the core problem I’ve stated. The light mode background/surface relationship was broken and didn’t let us build up the rest of the system in a rational manner. It was the turd in the color system punch bowl to put it indelicately. Let me just cut to the chase and show you what we ended up with.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"/blog/material-you-critique-light-mode-background-color-m3/6.webp\" alt=\"Our final version — light mode.\"><figcaption>Our final version — light mode.</figcaption></figure>\n<figure><img src=\"/blog/material-you-critique-light-mode-background-color-m3/7.webp\" alt=\"Our final version — dark mode.\"><figcaption>Our final version — dark mode.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Honestly, they’re not as exciting now that the surfaces have lost their color tint. To our eyes, though (or should I say brains), they make sense. In our updated version, color is applied consistently and rationally between the two modes, and they’re easier to look at and process quickly. All fancy rationale aside, they’re probably better for users.</p>\n<h1 id=\"design-quirk-or-showstopper\"><a href=\"#design-quirk-or-showstopper\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Design quirk or showstopper?</h1>\n<p>At the end of the day, we worked around this glitch in the Matrix and built a custom color system still heavily based on M3. I don’t love that we can’t use it in its pure form, but we are embracing most of the concepts they put forward, including the use of tokens. If you haven’t checked out the excellent <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Figma-Tokens\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Figma Tokens</a> plugin, I highly recommend it. There’s some superb thinking behind M3, but we think this background/surface relationship is going to continue being a problem if it’s not changed.</p>\n<p>All pedantry aside, it’s exciting times in the design world! The M3 update was and continues to be impressive as it rolls out. Material Design hadn’t changed in a good while before this, and it was cool to see all the new screenshots fly by in the promo videos.</p>\n<p>As always, you need to dig into the specifics to understand how any system will work. Design is a surprisingly analytical practice when it comes down to it, and if you make a mistake or exception in your first principles, it can have ripple effects throughout the rest of the system.</p>\n<p>What do you think? Have you tried using M3? Am I missing something or being overly critical? I’m curious to hear other people’s opinions, and I’m sure there’ll be no shortage of them as Material Design continues to exert its outsized influence in our design lives.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello Montreal!
