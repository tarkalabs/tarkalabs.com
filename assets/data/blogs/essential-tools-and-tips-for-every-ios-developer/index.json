Over time, some of these have become absolute essentials in my arsenal of applications, and here they are.</p>\n<h1 id=\"cleaner-for-xcode\"><a href=\"#cleaner-for-xcode\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Cleaner for Xcode</h1>\n<p>If you’ve used Xcode, you know that it’s notorious for eating up disk space. This is particularly true when you update to a newer version of Xcode, because many old files that are no longer required are leftover. This app helps remove unwanted and deprecated files associated with Xcode. It can also clean up all derived data and caches and free up disk space.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cleaner-for-xcode/id1296084683?mt=12&#x26;source=post_page-----e8c422f150b4--------------------------------\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Cleaner for Xcode</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"rectangle-a-window-manager\"><a href=\"#rectangle-a-window-manager\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Rectangle: A Window Manager</h1>\n<p>Quite often, using multiple apps is a necessity. Although window management on Windows is excellent, it could use some enhancements on a Mac. Rectangle steps in to improve window management with keyboard shortcuts and snap areas. I’ve relied on this application, as well as its predecessor, <a href=\"www.spectacleapp.com\">Spectacle</a>, for years, and they’ve proven to be extremely useful for multitasking.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://rectangleapp.com/?source=post_page-----e8c422f150b4--------------------------------\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Rectangle: A Window Manager</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"sf-symbols\"><a href=\"#sf-symbols\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>SF Symbols</h1>\n<p>With SF Symbols, you can incorporate a vast and expanding range of icons into your applications. The best part is that the library keeps growing every year, so you’ll always have fresh icons to work with.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/?source=post_page-----e8c422f150b4--------------------------------\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SF Symbols</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"sigma\"><a href=\"#sigma\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Sigma</h1>\n<p>Sigma, a nifty Figma plugin, is a game-changer for iOS developers that automatically generates SwiftUI code from your designs. I personally haven’t used it much, but with my limited testing, I think it works fine. This time-saving tool can streamline the design-to-development process, and I expect it to be a good time-saver.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1055606842094169320/sigma?source=post_page-----e8c422f150b4--------------------------------\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Sigma</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"amphetamine\"><a href=\"#amphetamine\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Amphetamine</h1>\n<p>This one’s pretty straightforward.
