Instead of following the traditional\nimperative way of doing things step-by-step, FP focuses on creating clean,\npredictable code by treating functions as first-class citizens.\nIt’s like the stand-up comedy of coding: sharp, witty, and always on\npoint.</p>\n<p>A lot of jargon in the introduction itself?

Even in boundaries of strict OOP languages.</li>\n<li>Your code doesn’t need to be 100% functional. Try to keep it as immutable and pure as humanely possible.</li>\n<li>FP doesn’t make you cool. It may do a little bit of idiot-proofing though.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure><img src=\"/blog/functional-programming-for-humans-foundation/I-ate-monad-for-breakfast-and-two-endofunctors-for-lunch.webp\" alt=\"I ate a monad for breakfast and two endofunctors for lunch\"><figcaption>I ate a monad for breakfast and two endofunctors for lunch</figcaption></figure>\n<hr/>\n<p>Today we’ll go through a few jargon to set the stage for upcoming adventures.

Good Alice is 25 years old, to begin with. If I come to the last line directly and want to know the age of Alice(aka <code class=\"language-inline-text\">person</code>), I’ll have to track this <code class=\"language-inline-text\">person</code> object everywhere and carefully understand who modified it and “how”.</p>\n<p>Let’s fix this mutation:</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span> <span class=\"token function\">updateAge</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">obj<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> newAge</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> <span class=\"token operator\">...</span>obj<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token literal-property property\">age</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> newAge <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">// Example usage:</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> person <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token literal-property property\">name</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'Alice'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token literal-property property\">age</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token number\">25</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token function\">updateAge</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>person<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">26</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// { name: 'Alice', age: 26 }</span>\nconsole<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>person<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span> <span class=\"token comment\">// { name: 'Alice', age: 25 }</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Now, anywhere we meet this <code class=\"language-inline-text\">person</code>, we are guaranteed to know its state by seeing it’s original definition.

If someone later wanna know the age of <code class=\"language-inline-text\">updatedPerson</code> , he’ll just jump to the place where it is first defined. Savvy?</p>\n<p>Benefits you ask. Here are a few:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It becomes easy for the language’s internal tools to clean the used memory, aka, garbage collection.</li>\n<li>An implicit guarantee that value will remain consistent throughout the life of a variable.</li>\n<li>A ton of predictability in the code. You can just skim a few lines and tell what the value is at any point in time, without reading the entire code.</li>\n<li><strong>Idiot proofing. You know that someone else won’t modify what you read the first time. Ah!
