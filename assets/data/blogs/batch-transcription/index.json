Map state</h3>\n<p>The Map state executes tasks concurrently.\nIt accepts a list of items as input, and you can define task states to process each item in parallel.\nIn our case, we’ve defined the <strong>Process Transcription</strong> state to handle the transcription results.\nThe Map state comes in two variants: <strong>INLINE</strong> and <strong>DISTRIBUTED</strong>.\nYou can use <strong>INLINE</strong> if the number of concurrent iterations won’t exceed 40.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"Map\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"Type\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Map\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"ItemProcessor\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"ProcessorConfig\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"Mode\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"INLINE\"</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"StartAt\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Process transcription\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    <span class=\"token property\">\"States\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"Process transcription\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token property\">\"Type\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Task\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>...<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n      <span class=\"token property\">\"error handler\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span><span class=\"token property\">\"Type\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Pass\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> ...<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"End\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3 id=\"7-process-transcription-state\"><a href=\"#7-process-transcription-state\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>7. Process transcription state</h3>\n<p>This is a Task state that invokes the <strong>Process Transcription Lambda</strong>.\nThe Process Transcription Lambda function downloads, formats, and saves the results to our system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"8-error-handler-state\"><a href=\"#8-error-handler-state\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>8. Error handler state</h3>\n<p>The Map state includes an error handler state.\nIf an unknown runtime exception occurs during any concurrent iteration, the Map state would typically stop the entire iteration.\nFor example, imagine you have 10 concurrent iterations and one of them fails.\nIn such a scenario, the Map state might halt all other executions.\nTo prevent this, we’ve defined an error handler state that acts as a Pass state.\nThis mechanism provides a fallback in case of failures, allowing other iterations to continue processing.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"error handler\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"Type\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Pass\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"End\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token boolean\">true</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<h3 id=\"9-fail-state\"><a href=\"#9-fail-state\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>9. Fail state</h3>\n<p>The Fail state in the Step Function flow is used to capture failures.\nThere are scenarios where you need to divert the flow to this state.\nFor example, if any error occurs in the Create Transcription, Get Transcription Status, or Get Transcription Files states, we set the next step as the Fail state.\nAn explicit Fail state allows you to set up CloudWatch alarms, collect metrics, and perform other actions in response to failures.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"json\"><pre class=\"language-json\"><code class=\"language-json\"><span class=\"token property\">\"Fail\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token property\">\"Type\"</span><span class=\"token operator\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"Fail\"</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Step Functions are a powerful tool for orchestrating Lambda invocations.\nWhile Azure Batch Transcription can accept 300 requests per minute, each request is limited to around 1,000 recording files.\nTo bring transcription results into your system quickly and efficiently,\nit’s recommended to split your audio files into batches of 10–15 recordings each and make multiple Create Transcription calls.\nThis approach effectively manages Azure Batch Transcription’s request limits while ensuring a smooth, efficient workflow for your audio data.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: We used polling to periodically check the transcription status due to business logic constraints. While our approach is functional, Azure Cognitive Service web hooks offer an alternative solution.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conclusion\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>In this post, we explored Azure Batch Transcription APIs and demonstrated how Step Functions can orchestrate Lambdas for seamless data transcription.\nThat’s a wrap!
