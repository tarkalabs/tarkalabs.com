We all know the security implication of opening up our server runtime to external code and if not done correctly, the results are deadly ranging from losing our user’s data to raising our cloud servers bills because of mining injections.</p>\n<img src=\"/blog/javascript-sandbox-for-your-node-project/hacker.webp\">\n<p>Fortunately, there is a package called vm2 which provides a sandbox for such situations so that we can provide the flexibility for our users and also keep our servers safe.

Function registerListeners will add the listener to VM and function cleanup will remove the listener from VM. This part is just to make sure the Node process won’t exit due to the user entered code.\nMoving on to executeJS function where all the magic happens, NodeVM uses callbacks in the sandbox i.e. (after the execution of code a callback will be called by sandbox to convey the result of execution) but usually, we prefer async/await for such functionality as some code will be waiting for the result of user JS execution.</p>\n<img src=\"/blog/javascript-sandbox-for-your-node-project/callback.png\">\n<p>So using promises we made this function async. Now executeJS take 2 arguments code &#x26; context. Context is a JSON object which is made available to the user entered JS code, code can make changes to context and after execution, context can be used further. In this way, we make sure that the JS execution sandbox is working as a transformer. Which at the core just modifies the context. But due to this structure for the Node process, the executeJS function is a BlackBox transformer making it better streamlined with your existing system.</p>\n<p>Next, we declare func, which is nothing but the user entered code enclosed in a function that is exported. Now we have taken care of exception handling with the exported function itself. As we discussed that VM uses callbacks so we are passing context in the first argument and 2 callbacks to handle success(resolve) &#x26; failure(reject) cases. Then we will register listeners to VM. vm.run will return the exported function we formulated in func.</p>\n<p>The final step is to call the exported function and passing context &#x26; callbacks. In the callbacks, we are calling cleanup to remove listeners from VM and resolving or rejecting the promise accordingly.\nLet’s test this,</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-code-title\"><span>test.js</span></div><div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"javascript\"><pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code class=\"language-javascript\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">test</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">async</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">try</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> code <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token template-string\"><span class=\"token template-punctuation string\">`</span><span class=\"token string\">\n            if (!context.day || !context.date) {\n                throw new Error('Day and Date both are required!');\n            }\n            let holidayInfo = utils.isHoliday({ date: context.date });\n            if(holidayInfo.holiday) {\n                context.plan = 'Happy ' + holidayInfo.name;\n            } else if (context.day.toLowerCase() == 'sunday' || context.day.toLowerCase() == 'saturday') {\n                context.plan = 'Its Weekend!
