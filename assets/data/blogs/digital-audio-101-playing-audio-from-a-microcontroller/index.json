Adding audio to your Arduino projects can make them very interesting. In this article, we will delve into some basic theory of digital audio &#x26; try to get a simple music output on your microcontroller.</p>\n<p>The theory &#x26; functionality described in this article is not specific to any microcontroller or development framework (Although I’m working with a K210 development board with kendryte-standalone-sdk) &#x26; does not require any audio specific libraries.</p>\n<h1 id=\"things-you-will-require-to-follow-along\"><a href=\"#things-you-will-require-to-follow-along\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Things you will require to follow along</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>A microcontroller (&#x26; programmer if required).</li>\n<li>An <strong>active</strong> buzzer module / speaker.</li>\n<li>Jumper wires.</li>\n<li>A 220<strong>Ω</strong> resistor.</li>\n<li>A breadboard.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"a-basic-introduction-to-digital-audio\"><a href=\"#a-basic-introduction-to-digital-audio\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>A Basic Introduction to Digital Audio</h1>\n<p>So what is audio/sound? In the simplest terms, <em>the sensation of sound is a result of vibrations in the air caused by pressure fluctuations.</em></p>\n<p>A speaker is a simple device that can be used to play audio. A speaker has a voice coil, a permanent magnet &#x26; a cone. When we pass electricity through the voice coil, it acts as an electromagnet &#x26; the permanent magnet either repels or attracts the voice coil based on the polarity of the electromagnet. The voice coil is attached to the cone, so any movement of the voice coil itself causes the cone to be pulled inward or pushed outward. This motion of the cone creates pressure variations in the air around it causing it to vibrate creating sound. This is an oversimplified explanation, but good enough to get us going.</p>\n<h2 id=\"graphical-representation-of-audio\"><a href=\"#graphical-representation-of-audio\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Graphical Representation of Audio</h2>\n<img src=\"/blog/digital-audio-101-playing-audio-from-a-microcontroller/1.webp\">\n<p>Like we just discussed, audio is a result of pressure variation of the air around us. These pressure variations can either be compressions or rarefactions of the air. A speaker produces these compressions and rarefactions by moving the cone rapidly. The magnitude and direction of the cone is varied by the changing the voltage (and in-turn current) supplied to the voice coil.</p>\n<p>The pressure variations of the air produced or the audio signal passed into the voice coil of a speaker to create sound can be represented in a coordinate based graph as shown in the image above and is called an audio waveform.</p>\n<p>The simplest audio waveforms are sinusoidal in nature, a curve representing periodic oscillations of constant amplitude as given by a sine function.</p>\n<p>In fact, single musical notes are sinusoids of a constant frequency produced by simple harmonic motions. As an example, here is the waveform of an “A” note:</p>\n<figure><img src=\"/blog/digital-audio-101-playing-audio-from-a-microcontroller/2.webp\" alt=\"Waveform of an A note represented by the function **f(x) = sin(2PI*440x)**\"><figcaption>Waveform of an A note represented by the function <strong>f(x) = sin(2PI*440x)</strong></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Many complex sounds like chords are created by adding the functions of the individual component notes.</p>\n<p>Now lets take a look at some of the elements &#x26; properties of the graph and see how they affect the sound produced by the waveform.</p>\n<img src=\"/blog/digital-audio-101-playing-audio-from-a-microcontroller/3.webp\">\n<p>As you can see in the above images, a sinusoidal audio waveform has the following properties:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Amplitude</strong> — The amplitude is the height of a point in the waveform measured from the reference line or origin. An increase in the amplitude results in an increase in the intensity of the sound. Sound with increased intensity is perceived as being louder.</li>\n<li><strong>Frequency</strong> — Sinusoids are repetitive in nature. The number of times a cycle is repeated in one second is called the frequency of a waveform and the time taken to complete one cycle is the period of a waveform. Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). One cycle per second is one Hertz. Sounds of increased frequency have a higher pitch while sounds of lower frequency have a lower pitch. Human beings can only hear sounds ranging from 20Hz to 20,000Hz (or 20 KHz).</li>\n<li><strong>Wavelength</strong> — Wavelength is the distance between two identical points in consecutive repeating waveforms. The wavelength is indirectly proportional to the frequency. So higher wavelengths results in lower pitched sounds.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are more properties &#x26; measurements that can be made on an audio waveform represented in the time domain. But for the sake of simplicity, we will stop it here.</p>\n<h1 id=\"pulse-width-modulation-pwm\"><a href=\"#pulse-width-modulation-pwm\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</h1>\n<p>While working with electronics &#x26; digital signals, we generally work with direct current. Direct current cannot switch polarity. Digital signals can only have two states either ON (1 — High Voltage) or OFF (0 — Low Voltage). Some microcontrollers have built in DAC (Digital to analog converter) which converts your digital signals to an analog output. We can also rely on external DACs to do the same but wiring DACs can take up multiple GPIOs on your microcontroller. We have a couple of other options too. It is possible to use a programmable arbitrary waveform generator like the AD9833BRMZ.</p>\n<div class=\"center-content\">\n  <img src=\"/blog/digital-audio-101-playing-audio-from-a-microcontroller/4.webp\" alt=\"Shortcuts xml file\" style=\"width:400px;\"/>\n</div>\n<p>This again requires additional wiring and plenty of additional code. To keep things as simple as possible, we will be using a technique called pulse width modulation. To understand how pulse width modulation works, let’s first look at a digital signal graph.</p>\n<img src=\"/blog/digital-audio-101-playing-audio-from-a-microcontroller/5.webp\">\n<p>In the above image, the amplitude represents the voltage of the digital signal and time is represented on the X axis. As discussed above, the change in voltage is almost instant and a digital signal can have only two states.</p>\n<p>By repeatedly turning the signal on and off, we can control the average voltage that is outputted on the line over time. The amount of time that such a signal remains in the ON (High/1) state is called its <strong><em>duty cycle.</em></strong> By altering the duty cycle, we can alter the average voltage coming out of the line.</p>\n<p>So if the signal remains ON (High/1) only 50% of the time, then the average voltage or the duty cycle is only 50% of the original supply voltage.</p>\n<p>PWM has many use cases in digital signal processing. For our purposes, we will use PWM to vary the average voltage supplied to our Active Buzzer or Speaker.</p>\n<h1 id=\"wiring-up\"><a href=\"#wiring-up\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Wiring Up</h1>\n<p>The circuit to connect a speaker or Active buzzer to your microcontroller is a fairly simple one. Please note that I am using a 0.5W speaker with a voltage requirement of 1V at 1KHz and an impedance of 8<strong>Ω</strong>. If your voltage requirements are higher, you can use a transistor with an external power source to amplify your signal. Both diagrams are given below.</p>\n<img src=\"/blog/digital-audio-101-playing-audio-from-a-microcontroller/6.webp\">\n<h1 id=\"playing-notes\"><a href=\"#playing-notes\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Playing Notes</h1>\n<p>Like discussed before, notes are sinusoidal waves of simple harmonic motions. Here is a list of frequencies for notes on the 4th Octave.</p>\n<div class=\"center-content\">\n  <img src=\"/blog/digital-audio-101-playing-audio-from-a-microcontroller/7.webp\" alt=\"Shortcuts xml file\" style=\"width:400px;\"/>\n</div>\n<p>In order to recreate the above frequencies in PWM, Let’s take a look at some sample code.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"c\"><pre class=\"language-c\"><code class=\"language-c\"><span class=\"token macro property\"><span class=\"token directive-hash\">#</span><span class=\"token directive keyword\">define</span> <span class=\"token macro-name\">NOTE_FREQ_A</span> <span class=\"token expression\"><span class=\"token number\">493.88</span></span></span>\n\n<span class=\"token macro property\"><span class=\"token directive-hash\">#</span><span class=\"token directive keyword\">define</span> <span class=\"token macro-name\">SEC_IN_uSEC</span> <span class=\"token expression\"><span class=\"token number\">1000000</span></span></span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">void</span> <span class=\"token function\">play_note_a</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">double</span> note_frequency <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> NOTE_FREQ_A<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">double</span> note_period <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span> <span class=\"token operator\">/</span> note_frequency<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">*</span> SEC_IN_uSEC<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">double</span> total_duration <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">while</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>total_duration <span class=\"token operator\">&lt;=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>SEC_IN_uSEC<span class=\"token operator\">/</span><span class=\"token number\">4</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    total_duration <span class=\"token operator\">+=</span> note_period<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">gpiohs_set_pin</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>SPEAKER_OUT<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">usleep</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>note_period<span class=\"token operator\">/</span><span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">gpiohs_set_pin</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>SPEAKER_OUT<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token function\">usleep</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>note_period<span class=\"token operator\">/</span><span class=\"token number\">2</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The above code is mostly generic except for the <code class=\"language-inline-text\">usleep and gpiohs_set_pin</code> function calls. You can replace these function calls with your microcontroller SDK specific functions for <code class=\"language-inline-text\">sleeping or delaying in microseconds(usleep)</code>&#x26; <code class=\"language-inline-text\">gpio digital control (gpiohs_set_pin).</code> These functions in the above code are specific to K210 (kendryte-standalone-sdk).</p>\n<p>In the above code, first, we are assigning the frequency of the note to a double variable <code class=\"language-inline-text\">(note_frequency)</code>. Then we calculate the period of each cycle for that frequency, convert the period from seconds to microseconds and store it in another double variable <code class=\"language-inline-text\">(note_period)</code>. The formula for calculating period is <code class=\"language-inline-text\">period (in sec) = 1/frequency (in Hz).</code></p>\n<p>The <code class=\"language-inline-text\">total_duration</code> is nothing but the duration for which a note is played. We add the periods of each cycle to the total duration and compare it with the desired duration value.</p>\n<p>Inside the loop, we first set the output pin on the microcontroller to HIGH (1), then we wait for half the amount of calculated period &#x26; then set the output pin to LOW (0) and again wait for half the amount of calculated period. This way, we are operating at 50% duty cycle.</p>\n<p>You can experiment further with chords and other complex audio structures. Make your Arduino projects more interesting with audio output! :) Cheers.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hello Montreal!
