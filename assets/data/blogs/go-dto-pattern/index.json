These rules work for almost all CRUD cases and a couple of other cases.\nIf they are not applicable, I try improvising on top of them.</p>\n<p>The entity/model that is going to be affected (Article, Authentication, Socket, etc) makes the first word in the name.\nThis can be omitted if the action in second point is self-defining (for example, authentication).\nThe type of action (Create, Update, Signup, etc) comes second in the name. They can be chained or omitted if being re-used or if not applicable.\nWhether it is for Request or Response forms the third part of the name, and it’ll be omitted if they are reused for both.\nThe DTOs are grouped into a file based on the first part of its name in singular form, which is the entity/model it affects.\nI’ll give a few examples which apply these rules:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-inline-text\">dtos/article.go</code> may contain CRUD DTOs like ArticleListResponseDto, ArticleCreateRequestDto, ArticleCreateUpdateResponseDto, etc.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-inline-text\">dtos/authentication.go</code> may contain more action based DTOs like SigninRequestDto, SignupRequestDto, etc.</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-inline-text\">dtos/socket.go</code> may contain generic DTOs like SocketRequestDto, SocketResponseDto, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"parsing-and-validation\"><a href=\"#parsing-and-validation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Parsing and Validation</h1>\n<p>I use tags to assist in parsing to and from JSON.\nTags can also be used for defining rules for each field in the DTO and validating using the <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-playground/validator/v10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">validator</a> package.\nSo, my DTOs might looks like:</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"go\"><pre class=\"language-go\"><code class=\"language-go\"><span class=\"token keyword\">type</span> SignupRequestDTO <span class=\"token keyword\">struct</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  Name     <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span> <span class=\"token string\">`json:\"name\" validate:\"required\"`</span>\n  Username <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span> <span class=\"token string\">`json:\"username\" validate:\"required\"`</span>\n  Email    <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span> <span class=\"token string\">`json:\"email\" validate:\"required,min=5\"`</span>\n  Password <span class=\"token builtin\">string</span> <span class=\"token string\">`json:\"password\" validate:\"required,min=8\"`</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>I personally do the parsing and validation in a single util method.\nThis is because failure in parsing would also indicate a validation failure on the request body structure.\nIf parsing works out well, we can validate other constraints we set for the DTO fields using the validate tags.\nWe loop through the validation errors and generate appropriate error messages for them.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\"

href=\"https://github.com/go-playground/validator\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Github</a>.</p>\n<p>Now, when I have to parse a request body to DTO, I’ll pass the pointer to the DTO.\nThe function will parse and map to the fields in DTO passed by its pointer.\nIf there are any errors, we get a map with errors list inside it.</p>\n<div class=\"gridsome-highlight\" data-language=\"go\"><pre class=\"language-go\"><code class=\"language-go\">requestDTO <span class=\"token operator\">:=</span> <span class=\"token function\">new</span><span class=\"token

aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Overall, this flow has been pretty convenient to use in my Go-based web projects.\nI write validation tags only in Request DTOs and only on fields that require them.\nBut, I’ve consistently written JSON tags for all fields regardless of whether they are required or not.</p>\n<p>Do let me know in the comments if you improvise on this.</p>\n"},"blogs":{"edges":[{"node":{"tag":"web","title":"Building a Scalable Ingestion Pipeline with Rust","description":"Large industrial pipelines running down a steep, grassy
