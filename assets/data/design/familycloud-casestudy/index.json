We also talked to users and stakeholders to find out what issues they were facing. The main things we heard were the need to make adding new documents easier and to have a simple, intuitive interface for less tech-savvy users.\nOne interesting insight we found was that people, especially younger users, don't typically catalog their files. According to The Verge article , they prefer quick and easy access without the hassle of organizing everything into folders. This trend highlighted the need for an intelligent system that can automatically manage and organize files without requiring manual input from users. With this in mind, we knew we needed to make adding new documents easier.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/familycloud/digging_into_competetion.webp\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"customer-interviews--prototype-testing--customer-journey--user-personas-information-architecture\"><a href=\"#customer-interviews--prototype-testing--customer-journey--user-personas-information-architecture\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Customer interviews / Prototype testing / Customer journey / User personas /Information architecture</h3>\n<h1 id=\"building-blocks\"><a href=\"#building-blocks\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Building blocks</h1>\n<h2 id=\"a-flexible--future-ready-system\"><a href=\"#a-flexible--future-ready-system\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>A flexible &#x26; future-ready system</h2>\n<p>Once we had a visual direction it was time to chart out the core building blocks. The system had to be modular in order to ensure future growth potential and scalability. Unlike building a house, a digital product requires simultaneous design of functionality and its supporting building blocks. By revisiting this process throughout the course of the project, we ended up with a robust, scalable design system expressed in a consistent visual language.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1075976623?h=ea9c11f8b0&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; picture-in-picture\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/familycloud/building_block.webp\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n</figure>\n<h1 id=\"solutions\"><a href=\"#solutions\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Solutions</h1>\n<h2 id=\"ai-solutions-for-family-data-harmony\"><a href=\"#ai-solutions-for-family-data-harmony\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>AI solutions for family data harmony</h2>\n<p>Finally, after taking everything into account, we got to work on the design. The result? A fully improved UI powered by AI features that aren’t just trendy extras but a key part of the system. These updates make every process smoother and take the app experience to the next level.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1075976427?h=ea9c11f8b0&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; picture-in-picture\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"ai-that-works-for-you\"><a href=\"#ai-that-works-for-you\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>AI that works for you</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest improvements was adding an AI assistant designed to make managing family information easy. It doesn’t just answer your questions—it can also take actions within the app for you. Need to find a specific document, update details, or set a reminder? The chatbot’s got you covered.</p>\n<div class=\"purple-container\">\n  <div class=\"iframe-container\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1075976519?h=96c2ce5e8e&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" \n            frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; picture-in-picture\">\n    </iframe>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"action-based-onboarding\"><a href=\"#action-based-onboarding\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Action-based onboarding</h2>\n<p>A strong onboarding experience is essential for retaining new users and boosting upsell opportunities. Traditional screens often fail as users forget what they’ve read. To address this, we introduced interactive cards with action-based onboarding flows.</p>\n<p>This hands-on approach helps users quickly understand the app, increasing engagement, retention, and trust, while opening the door to premium upsells.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1075976657?h=ea9c11f8b0&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; picture-in-picture\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"effortless-file-addition\"><a href=\"#effortless-file-addition\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Effortless file addition</h2>\n<p>One of the biggest changes we made was simplifying how files are added, addressing key frustrations around file management and organization. Previously, users had to navigate to specific groups to add items, making the process time-consuming.\nWe added an “Add New” button, allowing users to add items anytime, anywhere.</p>\n<p>We integrated AI to automatically name and catalog files. Users can drop files into a queue, let the AI handle the organization, and return later to adjust locations if needed.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1075976722?h=ea9c11f8b0&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; picture-in-picture\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"add-items-with-ease\"><a href=\"#add-items-with-ease\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Add items with ease</h2>\n<p>Another major improvement, which took a lot of effort, was refining the process of adding new items. Previously, adding things like financial records or contacts was like navigating through a maze in a clunky modal—confusing and hard to expand. We tested various solutions, from expandable accordions to step-by-step processes, but it felt like users were skipping chapters in a book.</p>\n<p>In the end, we decided to tuck away some of the advanced steps behind buttons for more experienced users. This made the process much simpler and faster. Plus, the new structure with sections and modules is like having a flexible building that can easily accommodate future renovations.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1075976490?h=ea9c11f8b0&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; picture-in-picture\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"find-anything-anytime\"><a href=\"#find-anything-anytime\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Find anything, anytime</h2>\n<p>Next big improvement was the introduction of global search. This feature allows users to search not just documents, contacts, or credentials by name or content, but also actions they can take, no matter where they are in the app. Plus, we added a set of filters to make it even easier to find exactly what you’re looking for.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1075976672?h=ea9c11f8b0&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; picture-in-picture\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"simplifying-the-will-drafting-experience\"><a href=\"#simplifying-the-will-drafting-experience\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Simplifying the will drafting experience</h2>\n<p>We also redesigned the process of creating a will. Previously, it was complicated—users couldn’t review their choices or see where they were in the process. Now, the process is quick, and editing is simple and easy to understand for everyone.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1075976746?h=ea9c11f8b0&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; picture-in-picture\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"outcome\"><a href=\"#outcome\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Outcome</h1>\n<h2 id=\"easy-to-use-ai-powered-and-future-proof-app\"><a href=\"#easy-to-use-ai-powered-and-future-proof-app\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Easy to use, AI-powered, and future-proof app</h2>\n<p>In the end, we created an app that's simple for every family member to use. The AI enhancements significantly cut down the time needed to manage files and introduced smart, AI-focused features. Plus, we future-proofed the app with flexible solutions, ensuring it’s ready for whatever comes next.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/familycloud/outcome.webp\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n</figure>\n","type":"design","allowSearchEngineIndexing":true,"topImage":"/familycloud/family_cloud_header.webp"},"clients":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"33","name":"FamilyCloud","style":"electricIndigo","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"32","name":"Redacted","style":"fullBlack","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"31","name":"Redacted","style":"pricebook-orange","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"30","name":"Redacted","style":"electricIndigo","logo":""}},{"node":{"id":"27","name":"Hotstar","style":"fullBlack","logo":"org/hotstar.png"}},{"node":{"id":"26","name":"Framework","style":"fullBlack","logo":"org/framework.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"25","name":"Routinr","style":"purple-blue","logo":"org/routinr.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"22","name":"Beatclub","style":"dark-grey","logo":"org/beatclub.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"10","name":"EAM360","style":"eam-blue","logo":"org/eam360.svg"}}]}},"context":{}}
