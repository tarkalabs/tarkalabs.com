Thus ensuring future growth potential, scalability, and consistency.</p>\n<div class=\"flex-container\">\n  <div class=\"iframe-container\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1029990777?h=ea9c11f8b0&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; picture-in-picture\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <img src=\"/kriyadocs/atomic.png\" loading=\"lazy\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: contain;\"/>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"tokens-️\"><a href=\"#tokens-%EF%B8%8F\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Tokens ❤️</h2>\n<p>Tokens (AKA variables) are an indispensable tool in the dev world, and we're just now starting to see them creep into design. We applied this methodology to our color palette to create a truly flexible system that takes a simple set of hue values as input, and generates a full color palette that we can tune, refine, and adapt as needed. This has been a huge help in the development handoff process, especially when it comes to managing changes. It also lets us pull off another cool trick. More on that later.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1029993185?h=516601b038&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; picture-in-picture\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"solutions\"><a href=\"#solutions\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Solutions</h1>\n<h2 id=\"publish-without-the-hassle\"><a href=\"#publish-without-the-hassle\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Publish without the hassle</h2>\n<p>Let's take a quick tour of some of the many new and improved screens in the app.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dashboard-where-flexibility-meets-personality\"><a href=\"#dashboard-where-flexibility-meets-personality\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Dashboard where flexibility meets personality</h3>\n<p>The old dashboard lacked flexibility, making it difficult to adapt to the needs of different publishers. Each team has its own processes, and the previous setup just wasn't cutting it. So, we revamped the dashboard, adding customizable views like a Kanban board to give users full control over their workflow display. Plus, we threw in emojis to make it easier to spot different stages at a glance, adding a bit of personality and clarity to each column.</p>\n<div class=\"purple-container\">\n  <div class=\"iframe-container\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1029989391?h=96c2ce5e8e&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" \n            frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; picture-in-picture\">\n    </iframe>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"global-search--advanced-filters\"><a href=\"#global-search--advanced-filters\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Global search &#x26; advanced filters</h3>\n<p>With such a complex app, we knew we had to focus on findability to help users navigate smoothly and locate specific information with ease.

Users need to know which parts of an article are new, modified, or removed. The old version relied solely on color coding for these updates. So, we introduced different types of outlines and highlights to distinguish between new, modified, and removed content.</p>\n<p>On top of that, we gave users the freedom to leave comments and added a changelog feature to track all changes, making collaboration clearer and more efficient.</p>\n<img src=\"/kriyadocs/collaboration_full_flow.png\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"purple-container\"/>\n<div class=\"purple-container\">\n  <div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1029989450?h=00ba8d8dda&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" \n              frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; picture-in-picture\">\n  </iframe>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"improving-navigation\"><a href=\"#improving-navigation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Improving navigation</h3>\n<p>During testing, we found that navigating through complex, lengthy documents was a hassle.
