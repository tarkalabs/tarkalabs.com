We didn't stop there, though; we also got in touch with dealers, distributors, and folks who use <span class=\"redacted\">Pricebook</span> apps day in, day out to get the full scoop.</p>\n<h3 id=\"customer-interviews--prototype-testing--customer-journey--user-personas-information-architecture\"><a href=\"#customer-interviews--prototype-testing--customer-journey--user-personas-information-architecture\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Customer interviews / Prototype testing / Customer journey / User personas /Information architecture</h3>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/pricebook/research.png\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n</figure>\n<h1 id=\"building-blocks\"><a href=\"#building-blocks\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Building blocks</h1>\n<h2 id=\"a-flexible--future-ready-system\"><a href=\"#a-flexible--future-ready-system\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>A flexible &#x26; future-ready system</h2>\n<p>Once we had a visual direction it was time to chart out the core building blocks. The system had to be modular in order to ensure future growth potential and scalability. Unlike building a house, a digital product requires simultaneous design of functionality and its supporting building blocks. By revisiting this process throughout the course of the project, we ended up with a robust, scalable design system expressed in a consistent visual language.</p>\n<figure>\n<img src=\"/pricebook/building_blocks.png\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"branded-themes-with-tokens-️\"><a href=\"#branded-themes-with-tokens-%EF%B8%8F\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Branded themes with tokens ❤️</h2>\n<p>To cater to our client's need for white labeling, we embraced the power of Tokens (AKA variables), a staple in development, now making waves in design. We applied this concept to our color palette, creating a dynamic system that accepts basic hue values and generates a comprehensive palette. This approach is invaluable during development handoffs, simplifying change management. It also enables us to perform some neat design tricks, enhancing brand adaptability and ensuring our designs meet diverse brand requirements with ease.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1026516921?h=d03cd5b084&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" \n            frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; picture-in-picture\">\n    </iframe>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"solutions\"><a href=\"#solutions\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Solutions</h1>\n<h2 id=\"the-evolution-of-span-classredactedpricebookspan-into-a-unified-software-suite\"><a href=\"#the-evolution-of-span-classredactedpricebookspan-into-a-unified-software-suite\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The evolution of <span class=\"redacted\">Pricebook</span> into a unified software suite</h2>\n<p>Each application served unique user personas, each with distinct needs.
