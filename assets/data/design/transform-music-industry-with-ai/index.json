The existing setup left no room to add new features, and without interactive prototypes, it was hard to grab investors’ attention.</p>\n<h3 class=\"heading-size-8 title-reduced-margin\">Information architecture issues</h3>\n<p>Existing designs couldn't support new features, limiting growth and innovation.</p>\n<h3 class=\"heading-size-8 title-reduced-margin\">AI integration</h3>\n<p>Leveraging AI to attract new clients and optimize their processes was underdeveloped, requiring better alignment between technology and user needs.</p>\n<h3 class=\"heading-size-8 title-reduced-margin\">Investor roadblocks</h3>\n<p>Without a strong prototype, showcasing the platform's value and securing funding became more challenging.</p>\n<h3 class=\"heading-size-8 title-reduced-margin\">Framework constraints</h3>\n<p>Material Design 3 needed modifications to align with business-specific requirements.</p>\n<h1 id=\"living-system\"><a href=\"#living-system\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Living system</h1>\n<h2 id=\"crafting-a-scalable-vision\"><a href=\"#crafting-a-scalable-vision\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Crafting a scalable vision</h2>\n<p>Once we locked in the visual direction, it was time to lay down the core building blocks. The system needed to be modular to support future growth and scalability. Designing a digital product isn’t like building a house—you’re creating functionality and its supporting framework at the same time.</p>\n<p>Starting with Material Design 3 as our foundation, we customized it by incorporating <span class=\"redacted\">Songistry</span>'s brand style and adding bespoke components. We also ensured every element was fully interactive and ready to work seamlessly in prototypes.</p>\n<div style=\"display: flex; gap: 72px; margin-top: 144px;\">\n    <div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 72px; padding-top: 72px;\">\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"/songistry/living-system-1.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n        </figure>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"/songistry/living-system-2.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n        </figure>\n    </div>\n    <div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 72px;\">\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"/songistry/living-system-3.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n        </figure>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"/songistry/living-system-4.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n        </figure>\n    </div>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"solutions\"><a href=\"#solutions\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Solutions</h1>\n<h2 id=\"the-architecture-of-flow\"><a href=\"#the-architecture-of-flow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The architecture of flow</h2>\n<p>Every element now has its logical place, making the app intuitive and ready for future updates.

We introduced a suite of AI-driven features and brought them together under a new branded feature called Soundsync AI.</p>\n<p>This not only improves feature discoverability but also clearly highlights how AI enhances processes at every step of the user journey, making it seamless and more efficient.</p>\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"/songistry/soundsync-ai.webp\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n</figure>\n<h3 id=\"ai-powered-track-search\"><a href=\"#ai-powered-track-search\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>AI-Powered track search</h3>\n<p>With a large number of tracks and their variations, we recognized the need to streamline the search process. The “Search with SoundSync AI” feature allows users to quickly find tracks with similar characteristics, such as mood, vocals, BPM, or instruments. This significantly reduces the time needed to locate the right track, improving efficiency and keeping workflows smooth and productive.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1035510993?h=dac4ff1fd7&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Search\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"play-time\"><a href=\"#play-time\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Play time</h3>\n<p>The player was a key focus of the redesign. Its options allow users to seamlessly switch between track versions, making it effortless to find the exact one they need. The “one-click add” feature simplifies adding tracks to playlists, streamlining the process of organizing music for specific projects. Additionally, users can highlight and save specific clips by selecting fragments of a track, offering greater precision and flexibility in their workflow.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1035510878?h=c689a99877&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Player\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"music-data-at-your-fingertips\"><a href=\"#music-data-at-your-fingertips\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Music data at your fingertips</h3>\n<p>Platforms like Spotify, Instagram, YouTube, and X (formerly Twitter) generate vast amounts of data, but making sense of it can be overwhelming. Our design team worked to centralize this information within <span class=\"redacted\">Songistry</span>, creating an AI-powered analytics panel that provides creators with actionable insights like regional popularity, mood, and more.</p>\n<p>We focused on making these tools intuitive and accessible, helping creators uncover new opportunities to monetize their music. For example, we designed a seamless process for music supervisors to leverage AI to find tracks that align with specific audience demographics and moods, streamlining their workflow and delivering precise recommendations.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1035511022?h=d76e7a233f&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Data\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1035510860?h=189f20c811&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Track compare\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"personalized-licenses-maximized-sales\"><a href=\"#personalized-licenses-maximized-sales\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Personalized licenses, maximized sales</h3>\n<p>We reimagined the fragmented music pitching model by designing a seamless and efficient system that connects buyers and sellers. Our work focused on streamlining workflows to help monetize music and drive revenue growth for <span class=\"redacted\">Songistry</span>.</p>\n<p>To take track sales even further, we designed and implemented a custom license builder. This tool empowers supervisors to tailor pricing to their needs, while providing creators with more opportunities to market and sell their tracks effectively. Our approach ensured that both sides of the marketplace benefit from an intuitive and flexible solution.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1035510833?h=a048f13185&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Custom license\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"increasing-sales-with-briefs\"><a href=\"#increasing-sales-with-briefs\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Increasing sales with briefs</h3>\n<p>In the music industry, finding the perfect track for a project can be a time-consuming challenge. We’ve collaborated with\n<span class=\"redacted\">Songistry</span> to create a tool that allows supervisors to describe the track they’re looking for, giving artists a simple way to suggest tracks that match the brief.</p>\n<p>To enhance the process further, we integrated AI to provide intelligent recommendations that perfectly align with each brief. Our design bridges the gap between supervisors and artists, creating a seamless experience for matching the right track to the right project, while driving sales and improving platform efficiency.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1035511102?h=821b224bba&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Briefs\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"opening-for-a-new-type-clients\"><a href=\"#opening-for-a-new-type-clients\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Opening for a new type clients</h3>\n<p>Clients like Disney, who struggle to manage massive track libraries.

The previous form was cumbersome to use, so we streamlined the process for better usability. Additionally, we added support for different track versions and introduced markers to the player, enabling users to highlight various sections of a track with ease.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/1035510794?h=af4367cf28&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Forms\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"outcome\"><a href=\"#outcome\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Outcome</h1>\n<h2 id=\"a-platform-that-resonates\"><a href=\"#a-platform-that-resonates\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>A platform that resonates</h2>\n<p>We delivered a future-proof app powered by AI and data, designed to enhance user experience and drive sales.
