Instead, we decided to give the animation an illustrative and magical quality. This approach allowed us to convey the technical aspects of the laptop's modular design in a clear and accessible way, while also leaving ample room for viewers to visualize their own unique module ideas.</p>\n<div class=\"col center eql\">\n  <div class=\"stack\">\n    <div class=\"iframe-container square\">\n        <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/817315163?h=1478fd03af&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Framework Laptop 16 Animation\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"stack\">\n    <img src=\"/framework-launch-video/fw-look-2@2x.png\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"animation\"><a href=\"#animation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Animation</h1>\n<h2 id=\"centralising-the-animation\"><a href=\"#centralising-the-animation\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Centralising the animation</h2>\n<p>The input panel on the Framework Laptop 16 is designed with two rows â€“ top and bottom, each capable of accommodating three sizes of modules. Each row has its own insertion and release mechanisms. While all modules within a row use one mechanism, we needed to maintain this consistency with 15 unique modules while making the system adaptable through revisions. To achieve this, we developed a base animation for the insertion and release mechanisms using Blender. We stored these animations as actions and utilized the Non-Linear Animation (NLA) editor to structure and apply the animations to multiple objects centrally.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/817305001?h=6c603a33d3&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Framework Laptop 16 Animation\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"procedural-visualisations\"><a href=\"#procedural-visualisations\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Procedural visualisations</h2>\n<div class=\"col center eql\">\n  <div>\n    <div class=\"iframe-container square\">\n      <iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/817261324?h=25dec3e703&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\"  frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Display animation\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h3>Display animation</h3>\n    <p>To maintain a sense of continuity throughout the animation loop, we designed a display visualisation that spanned the video. Using Blender nodes allowed us to exercise complete control over the animation's speed, length, and visual aspects. For this purpose, we utilized a wave texture with black and white color that was run through the display object. By linking the wave's phase with the animation time and running a color spectrum through the white of the wave, we were able to create the fluid motion seen here.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col center eql\">\n  <div>\n    <div class=\"iframe-container square\">\n      <iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/817290113?h=dfeb1fc16a&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\"  frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"RGB Keyboard\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h3>RGB Keyboard</h3>\n    <p>Following the path we took for the display animation, we took a similar approach for the RGB colors at the back of the keys. Instead of running the color spectrum through the white of the wave, we directly applied it to the shape of the wave to achieve the fast-changing RGB colors. This technique ensured that the keyboard animation remained consistent with the display animation.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"col center eql\">\n  <div>\n    <div class=\"iframe-container square\">\n      <iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/817292202?h=1ed0b40799&amp;autopause=0&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\"  frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"LED Matrix\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h3>LED Matrix</h3>\n    <p>We created the 2D graphics for the LED matrix outside of blender and ran our wave visualisation through the white dots of the matrix, while the graphics texture ran a marquee loop.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"the-event\"><a href=\"#the-event\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The event</h1>\n<p>A still from the Framework event on March 2023.</p>\n<div class=\"col center eql\">\n    <img src=\"/framework-launch-video/fw-event-2023.png\" loading=\"lazy\"/> \n</div>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/817258577?h=76b3099e27\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n","type":"design","allowSearchEngineIndexing":true},"clients":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"26","name":"Framework","style":"fullBlack","logo":"org/framework.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"25","name":"Routinr","style":"purple-blue","logo":"org/routinr.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"22","name":"Beatclub","style":"dark-grey","logo":"org/beatclub.svg"}}]}},"context":{}}
