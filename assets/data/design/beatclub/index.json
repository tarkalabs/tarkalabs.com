Breaking into this world is incredibly difficult, especially given the proliferation in recent years of so called “bedroom producers” — artists making music on their laptops at home. Labels are constantly on the lookout for new artists to sign, but also material that they can use for the big artists they’re already working with. This pipeline has historically been fractured and inefficient, with no good way for smaller artists to get noticed, or for Artist &#x26; Repertoire (A&#x26;R) teams to find them. Enter Beatclub.</p>\n<h1 id=\"brief\"><a href=\"#brief\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Brief</h1>\n<h2 id=\"connecting-the-dots\"><a href=\"#connecting-the-dots\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Connecting the dots</h2>\n<p>Timbaland and his team from Universal Music Group came to us with a vision: Build a platform to connect not only the world’s beatmakers &#x26; bedroom producers with major labels, but also to give artists of all kinds powerful tools to collaborate and license their music.</p>\n<h1 id=\"exploration\"><a href=\"#exploration\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Exploration</h1>\n<h2 id=\"finding-the-right-beat\"><a href=\"#finding-the-right-beat\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Finding the right beat</h2>\n<p>There are times when you need to start vibing before you start thinking.

The system had to be modular in order to ensure future growth potential and scalability. Unlike building a house, a digital product requires simultaneous design of functionality and its supporting building blocks. By revisiting this process throughout the course of the project, we ended up with a robust, scalable design system expressed in a consistent visual language.</p>\n<div class=\"col center eql\">\n  <div class=\"stack\">\n    <img src=\"/beatclub/icons.png\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n    <img src=\"/beatclub/misc components.png\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"stack\">\n    <img src=\"/beatclub/rows.png\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n    <img src=\"/beatclub/cards n stuff.png\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"solutions\"><a href=\"#solutions\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Solutions</h1>\n<h2 id=\"play-time\"><a href=\"#play-time\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Play time</h2>\n<p>Through the course of many conversations, the Beatclub music player emerged as a central defining feature of the experience. It needed to evolve beyond a simple listening tool, packing features to help producers screen, save, annotate, and build upon existing tracks. A few key features are:</p>\n<div class=\"scroll\">\n  <div class=\"col eql\">\n    <div>\n      <div class=\"iframe-container portrait\">\n        <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/726195384?h=a7bb658a7e&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\"  frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Player waveform - mobile\"></iframe>\n      </div>\n      <h3>Listening with your eyes</h3>\n      <p>An audio waveform provides a visual way to assess the landscape of the track even before it starts playing.

We divided most layouts into three common sections: primary navigation to the left, user content to the right, search, filter and page content in a large central area.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-search-silo-problem\"><a href=\"#the-search-silo-problem\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>The search silo problem</h3>\n<p>A common problem that we see in some platforms is the search silo. When you enter a search term, you’re sent to a bespoke search results page that’s disconnected from the rest of the platform. If you want to refine your search, you have to start again with a new search. Fortunately, there’s a solution.</p>\n<div class=\"col center eql\">\n  <div>\n    <div class=\"iframe-container portrait\">\n      <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/727460395?h=43b746fadc&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\"  frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Search and filter\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h3>Search, meet filter</h3>\n    <p>We like to take an approach where search terms are treated as simply another type of filter. The active filters area suggests common filters based on what the user has already selected. The search box will  suggest known filter types when possible, or will convert a search term into a generic filter chip if not. This lets users mix and match search and filter to refine their results as they go, or go in another direction completely. It also allows us to avoid crafting one-off search results pages for each type of content, saving development effort and everyone’s sanity along the way.</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"on-your-desk--in-your-pocket\"><a href=\"#on-your-desk--in-your-pocket\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>On your desk &#x26; in your pocket</h2>\n<p>A modular, component-based approach helps encapsulate responsive behavior within the core building blocks. That means when it comes to designing for mobile, half the battle is already won. The other half is adapting the navigation to suit the mobile form factor.</p>\n<div class=\"media-block\">\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/beatclub/nesting.png\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</figure>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"/beatclub/track-row.png\" loading=\"lazy\">\n</figure>\n<div>\n  <div class=\"iframe-container\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/727460125?h=6addc7a07b&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Navigation - desktop\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"iframe-container portrait\">\n    <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/727460233?h=57cfd2c46c&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Navigation - mobile\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"forms-that-dont-suck\"><a href=\"#forms-that-dont-suck\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Forms that don’t suck</h2>\n<p>If a platform needs a lot of content to be successful, getting it on there better be easy. Good forms should accomplish two things: They should be easy for first time users, and fast for repeat users. The result? A streamlined process that respects users' time and energy.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/727981209?h=e8d524f8dd&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"File upload\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"drag-it-all-in\"><a href=\"#drag-it-all-in\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Drag it all in</h3>\n<p>We started by designing an upload queue where users can dump their files all at once. An intuitive progress tracker gives a birds-eye view of what’s left to do.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/727981149?h=88cfb637da&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Batch actions\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"complexity-only-when-you-need-it\"><a href=\"#complexity-only-when-you-need-it\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Complexity, only when you need it</h3>\n<p>Batch controls mean experienced users can upload large sound libraries and multiple tracks, then fly through processing them. Expandable option groups keep a minimal footprint until needed.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/727981276?h=aa8d75d41d&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Form sections\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"sections\"><a href=\"#sections\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Sections</h3>\n<p>The upload process is broken into clear sections that users can jump between with a click if needed. Progress is always saved automatically, with a summary of each completed section appearing when it’s collapsed.</p>\n<h2 id=\"an-opportunity-presents-itself\"><a href=\"#an-opportunity-presents-itself\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>An opportunity presents itself</h2>\n<p>The connection between label A&#x26;R teams and the vast untapped resource of bedroom producers has always been tenuous at best. Even when A&#x26;R teams can get music submissions, they don’t have good tools to manage and sort through them. To solve this problem, we created a first-class experience to connect the two.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/727981347?h=616d75d462&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Opportunities upload\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"crafting-a-vip-experience\"><a href=\"#crafting-a-vip-experience\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Crafting a VIP experience</h3>\n<p>Every producer on Beatclub has the chance to get a VIP invitation to the opportunities portal where they can submit work for consideration by labels representing major artists. It’s a perfect scouting tool for the labels, and an amazing opportunity for producers to get writing or production credits for top-level artists, and real compensation for their work.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/727981397?h=fade2280cb&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Sorting\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"sorting-at-the-speed-of-sound\"><a href=\"#sorting-at-the-speed-of-sound\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Sorting at the speed of sound</h3>\n<p>For A&#x26;R teams, getting submissions is half of the equation. Sorting through them is a different story. We built team functionality for labels that lets them invite members and set permissions. Team members with access can review submissions in a collaborative and open way that keeps everyone up to date, team and artist alike. When a piece of music is chosen, licensing can be finalized directly on the platform. Mutual access between new talent and labels has never been this easy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"beatclub-pro\"><a href=\"#beatclub-pro\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Beatclub Pro</h2>\n<p>Every free-to-use platform faces the inevitable question: What does our premium tier look like? We wanted to take advantage of the nature of the platform to create a premium experience that would be engaging and rewarding to buyers: Beatclub Pro.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/727981429?h=d73093889a&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Subscriber drop\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"subscriber-drop\"><a href=\"#subscriber-drop\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Subscriber drop</h3>\n<p>The first component of the Pro subscription is the Subscriber drop. Every month the Beatclub team collects three exclusive beats and one soundpack from top producers and posts it to the subscriber drop page. Subscribers can choose to redeem one item from the list as part of their membership.</p>\n<h3 id=\"track-challenge\"><a href=\"#track-challenge\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Track challenge</h3>\n<p>This is where things get fun. Subscribers get to upload their work as part of the monthly challenge. When judging closes for the month, the winning tracks are featured on the home page. Here’s the best part: the submissions are available for sale to be licensed and used elsewhere. By taking advantage of the marketplace framework already in place, Beatclub Pro creates a virtuous cycle where exclusive access and recognition aren’t the only things up for grabs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"notable-mentions\"><a href=\"#notable-mentions\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Notable mentions</h2>\n<h3 id=\"messaging\"><a href=\"#messaging\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Messaging</h3>\n<p>Task and app-switching consumes untold hours of time daily. Since user-to-user messaging was already a requirement for the platform, we extended the feature to include group messages. Ideal for A&#x26;R teams who spend their day on the platform anyway, and who want to take full advantage of the built-in sharing tools. Groups aren’t just for work though, they also allow platforms to foster community within their user base.</p>\n<div class=\"iframe-container\">\n  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/727981305?h=b3b0cb00d1&amp;badge=0&amp;background=1&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479\" width=\"3688\" height=\"2304\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen title=\"Live feed\"></iframe>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"live-feed\"><a href=\"#live-feed\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Live feed</h3>\n<p>Let’s face it — analytics are cool, but they can also be pretty dry. In an effort to create a positive feedback loop for new and veteran users alike, we designed the live feed panel. This lets users see engagement with their content in real time, letting them feel the action happening on their profile, and encouraging them to grow their music hustle further.</p>\n","type":"design"},"clients":{"edges":[{"node":{"id":"22","name":"Beatclub","style":"dark-grey","logo":"org/beatclub.svg"}},{"node":{"id":"25","name":"Routinr","style":"purple-blue","logo":"org/routinr.svg"}}]}},"context":{}}
