This is always a balance between acquiring the necessary information to empathize with user needs, but not becoming so accustomed to the norms of the existing products that we lose the valuable insights of a beginner‚Äôs mind.</p>\n<p>We spent time testing both the existing EAM360 app as well as the IBM Maximo web app on desktop to gain familiarity and identify pain points. We found issues with navigation and user workflows that were ripe for improvement.

The system had to be modular in order to ensure future growth potential and scalability.
